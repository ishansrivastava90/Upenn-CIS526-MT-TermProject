Experts say that the American president has started making efforts to save the falling image of America throughout the world, but that would be difficult for it, because as long as it will keep supporting the blood thirsty Israeli government, it can not be expected to do anything good.

Observers say that American President has started the struggle to strengthen the reducing cadre of America on International level but his success rate is very low as till the time America supports the brutal government of Israel nothing good is expected from America.

Until man realizes what is wrong and what is right, he continues to make mistakes.	Unless this feeling does not emerge in Human that what is right and wrong till then Human will keep doing mistakes.	It is a human mistake of doing wrong by not doing what is right.	-53.2148	-38.3752	-65.9788	-35.301	-53.4551	-37.4965	-67.501	-34.5469

For instance, when a thief goes to steal something, if he realizes at that time that stealing is wrong, it is a curse and it will bring punishment, and he fears Allah, that person will not steal.	As an example a thief when goes to steal if he at that time gets this thought that stealing is not a good thing and theft is a curse, there is also punishment in it and he fears from God then that Human will not steal.	If a thief robs a place, then he is in danger to rob the same place and same time tomorrow as well. If he fears god and man, he will not steal.	-142.399	-105.327	-131.93	-94.9866	-143.197	-103.561	-129.971	-96.1706

Similarly, as long as Israel does not realize that it is doing wrong, and spilling the blood of the innocent, and it will receive punishment for that, it will continue to play Holi with the blood of the innocent people in Gaza.	Same like this that unless Israel do not gets this apprehension that i am doing wrong and draining blood of innocents and i will get punishment for this, he will keep playing Holi with the blood innocents of Gaza till then.	Similarly, Israel should realised that it is a wrong thing to have bloodshed in Gaza.	-103.359	-99.1631	-138.118	-43.4124	-102.147	-94.0332	-137.007	-42.522

As for Barack Obama, history is witness that no American ruler has been able to go against the American policy and nor will they go. Whether the ruler is white or black, he is still a ruler.	In Israel, such tactics are used by ruling party to achieve public support.Historically no president was powerful enough to change American policies.Barrack Obama is no exception. Forces of Exploitation are similar in their character; whether they are black or white.	Considering elections, the rulers should do such activities for people's support. There is no doubt in this specially when countries like Israel exist. Rest talking about Barrack Obama, then history is the witness that no American leader has gone against the policy and nor will do it. Regime, whether black or white, is a regime.	As far as elections are concerned, it is not surprising that the people who are in power do such things to win the heart and mind of people especially in a state like Israel. And speaking of Barak Obama, history shows that no American president has wavered from the policy and will not do so in future.
