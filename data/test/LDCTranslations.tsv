If there were no religion, half the world would have been destroyed in the battle between blacks and whites and the rest in the animosity between races.	No, not at all. Sir, only religion teaches us that there is no white, no black, no Punjabi, and no refugee. If there had been no religion, then half of the world would have been destroyed in the war between white and black, and the rest would have fallen prey to enmity on the basis of cost and race.	No, absolutely not. Sir, religion preaches that there is no distinction either between a white and a black or a Punjabi and Muhajir. Had there been no religion, half the world would have been killed in the wars of color and the rest would have perished due to the enmities based on caste.	No, not at all, sir. Religion teaches no difference between a white and a black, a Punjabi and a Muhajir. If it was not for religion, this world would long ago have been destroyed in the name of white and black and countless other caste-based conflicts.

Humans did not come here on their own - the creator of the universe sent them here, and they must live according to His command.	In fact, religion provides moral training to human beings and makes them disciplined on the grounds that they have not been born with their own free will, but the Creator of the universe has sent them here and they have to live in this world in accordance with God's commands.	In fact it is the religion that provides moral training to the man and binds him that he has not come here on his own, rather he has been sent by the Creator of the universe and he has to spend his life according to His commandments.	Actually, it is only religion that teaches us moral values and asks us to follow it. It has not come on its own- the Creator of the Universe sent it (to us), and we have to live according to His orders.
