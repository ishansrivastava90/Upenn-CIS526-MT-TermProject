Experts say that is daunting task for obama to restore the international image of US. To obtain its lost credibility, American has to review its pro-Israel policies.	Experts say that the American president has started making efforts to save the falling image of America throughout the world, but that would be difficult for it, because as long as it will keep supporting the blood thirsty Israeli government, it can not be expected to do anything good. Therefore if America wants to save its image, it will have to stop its support of Israel and have to disassociate itself from Israel's crimes.	Observers say that American President has started the struggle to strengthen the reducing cadre of America on International level but his success rate is very low as till the time America supports the brutal government of Israel nothing good is expected from America. If America wishes to raise his cadre in the world then she must back off from Israel support and must not participate in her crimes.	326.867	329.5	0.869003527337	154.507	156.705	0.682411297852	219.735	215.689	1.00262605042	266.648	266.278	0.884159404503

For instance, when a thief goes to steal something, if he realizes at that time that stealing is wrong, it is a curse and it will bring punishment, and he fears Allah, that person will not steal.	As an example a thief when goes to steal if he at that time gets this thought that stealing is not a good thing and theft is a curse, there is also punishment in it and he fears from God then that Human will not steal.	If a thief robs a place, then he is in danger to rob the same place and same time tomorrow as well. If he fears god and man, he will not steal.	180.399	181.197	0.673368863049	219.327	217.561	0.522430555556	207.93	205.971	0.599237726098	132.987	134.171	0.583963178295

Similarly, as long as Israel does not realize that it is doing wrong, and spilling the blood of the innocent, and it will receive punishment for that, it will continue to play Holi with the blood of the innocent people in Gaza.	Same like this that unless Israel do not gets this apprehension that i am doing wrong and draining blood of innocents and i will get punishment for this, he will keep playing Holi with the blood innocents of Gaza till then.

It still seems that the copies of the 18th amendment is a political trickery, and no one is sincere about accepting that amendment.

This is why no fuss was made in the assembly or on the floor of senate over this amendment, and the parliament was not forced into accepting the amendment.	This is the reason why no one has made a fuss in the assembly or senate floor in the favor of this amendment nor has forced the assembly to approve this change.
