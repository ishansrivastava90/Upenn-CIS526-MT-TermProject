The role played by European Union for peace in Middle East.
Looking it from governments point of view, the efforts by European Union to stop the war in Middle East have been decisive.
According to the official stand of Brussels, Schwarzenberg delegation or efforts of Sarkozy are helping hands in this process.
European Union spokesman Amadeu Altafaj said every single step which may help in delivering the conjoint message of European Union to fighting parties is appreciable.
In light of the governments statement all seems to be fine.
but in reality the European Union is portraying a very disappointing picture of the internal tensions.
as the head of the Union, Czech republic's role is even weaker than before.
an on top of that the internal issues have made is helpless.
on the other hand the French president Sarkozy is behaving like if he is still the president of the European Union.
Whereas France has completed its presidential tenure of six months.
Sarkozy wants to play a leading role and he is capable of it but he does not have the permission to do it.
The most comedy situation is for the Ambassdor of France Mr. Bernard Kouchner
He is part of the delegation, which is being headed by Schwarzenberg, the foreign minister of Czech Republic.
What is even worse is that both the foreign ministers are giving different statements on the middle east war.
Schwarzenberg says that Israel has the right to defend herself, while according to Kouchner war is not the defense. Germany has also sent a special ambassador to Middle East. As long as European Union does not show unanimous stand, she can not be successful on diplomatic front.
its proof is the Israeli behavior which does not care about the efforts for reconciliation from the European Union.
This is the best time for European Union to prove herself, as America has failed in Middle East due to the policies of George W. Bush.
Economic setback: Suicide of German billionaire industrialist.
Adolf Merckle, a resident of Sawabia in Southern Germany left a huge business group behind him.
But earlier common German citizens did not know much about him.
when he had to negotiate with 30 banks who lent money to his industrial group, he became the topic of the headlines and he could foresee the murky future of the Merckle group.
The Merkel Group had to suffer financial losses of many millions of Euro after its investment to buy shares of German auto maker Volkswagen.
Then monetary institutions canceled this groups loan amounting 700 million and another 1 billion Euro that it necessarily required and hence Merkel came into extreme pressure.
Some time back the bank agreed to provide Merkel Group an emergency loan but Adolf Merkel who raised from a small industrialist to the position of a strong industrial group whose annual income was approximately 30 billion Euro, could not bare the loss in his investment capability.
After the death of his father, when Adolf Merkel took over his family business, he developed it quick, putting it on new lines.
He named his company Ratiopharm which is now Germany's most successful and biggest pharmaceutical company.
Some time back the commercial value of this company was in between 5 and 6 billion Euro and still was earning a revenue of 8.1 billion Euro annually. After the great success of Ratiopharm, the Merkel Group acquired many big businesses which included building materials maker Hydelberg cement to modified/special car maker Kassbohrer company.
The number of employees of the Merkel group around the world is near 100,000 and its foundation company, the pharmaceutical Ratiopharm always had special importance.
"Adolf Merkel has said many times in his life: ""It has been four generations since I started making medicine."
Now the industry is handled by the children and i hope that it continues to work for few hundred years by our family.
After the suicide of Adolf Merkel, the banks have provided approval for temporary loans of 400 million Euro for VEM Group but added the condition that VEM should sell off Ratiopharm to improve the financial situation for a long term sustainability.
After the death of Adolf Marclay the Marclay Group will not remain the same as it was before.

Ahlhaus presented an analysis report of provincial office of crime management prepared in 2006, according to which in the Bergdorf area of Hemberg the percentage of foreigners in the crimes committed there was calculated.
results showed that the foreigners here have
crime rate is less then the crimes committed in the whole province.
On the contrary during 2006 when youth crime rate in Berlin was observed revealed that the youth having the foreign background was .44
7 percent.
Other political parties of Germany like SPD, clean atmospherics party Greens, and leftist party Linkspartei are against the of gathering information whether the background of a German citizen is foreign while collecting the data about crimes.

Tea: an effective cure for breast cancer
According to a new research, drinking three cups of tea every day
reduces the danger of chest cancer in women under 50 years of age by 1/3rd.
This research from the Moffet Cancer Centre in Florida says that the chances of contracting lung cancer in women under the age of 50
who drink tea three times a day, are reduced by 37%
The research shows that the aged women dont get any effect from drinking three or more cups of tea a day.
Experts believe that the reason behind this is that tea has some elements that are effective against the formation of cancer cells in women mainly under the age of 50.
In Moffitt Cancer Center, in the city of Tampa, Florida state, a research was conducted on over 5000 women, who had undergone treatment for breast cancer.
Their ages were between 20 and 74 years.
Experts compared their medical records and lifestyles with women who were safe from breast cancer.
the experts also found out that on a particular type of cancer, Lobular, tea had shown a great effect and it reduced by 66 percent.
Every 10th patient of lung cancer falls under this type of cancer.
This type of chest cancer is dangerous because it is deep inside and usually diagnosed when it has spread alot.
Experts say that regular tea consumption, at least three cups a day, can drastically reduce the occurrence of breast cancer in young women.

In Britain, every year, approximately 40,000 women are diagnosed with breast cancer.

Why the reduction of exercise with increasing age?
New research
Exercise is good for health in any age.
This makes your heart stronger, decreases cholesterol levels, helps in reducing weight, helps stop diabetes and decreases the chances of Alzheimer's.
Unfortunately, with many people with increasing age reduces the ability to exercise.
experts say that exercise keep our body and brain active however age can affect it.
According to the American Medical Association, several health related problems can arise by not doing exercise.
Dr. Patricia Palecca of Mayo Clinic, Minnesota says that an increase in age is a major cause of inability to excercise and lack of bodily activity.
Dr. Patricia teaches medicine at Mayo Clinic.
She has done extensive research on older age and the ability to exercise with increasing age.
The team of doctors used high frequency sound waves to measure the working of the heart.
In which the pumping of the blood by the heart, its contraction and relaxation was studied.
The experts focussed on the left part of the heart which is the main part for pumping blood.
They came to know that with increase in age, problems increase in the relaxation action of heart.
Dr. Patricia says with increase in age, problems occur in the activity of relaxation of heart and with increase in age, this effects the ability to exercise.
Dr. Carwin Cain was also part of this research.
He says that we were surprised to see that it has an effect and it confirmed that bad exercising ability is very much related to the heart relaxing activity.
some times blood pressure can cause disorders in heart's functions and heart diseases.
If doctors and patients can work together when it comes to heart diseases, then they can enjoy the benefits of exercise even with older age.
A detailed report has been published in the Journal of American Medical Association.
There are no chances of an immediate war with Pakistan: Indian Army Chief.
Indian Army Chief General Deepak Kapoor has said that there are no chances of an immediate war with Pakistan how ever we are always ready to defend our country and sacrifice our lives for it.
General Kapoor blamed that despite of sureties and International pressure in result of Mumbai attacks, in his words, terrorism network is not only present in Pakistan but is also active.
He said this in an interview to journalists in Srinagar.
The Indian Army Chief was on a one day tour to the valley of Kashmir in order to analyze the overall security situation in New Delhi administered Kashmir and preparation of armed forces on the borders.
He was asked that according to media reports Pakistan has refused the proves of Mumbai attacks presented by India, what is his opinion in this regard?
General Kapoor said that the decisions of peace or war matters are taken by the political leadership.
Talking about the alleged terrorism network in Pakistan he said that Indian Army will have to face the forces which are objected to destroy peace and weaken India.
He said that 700 to 800 militants are present in Indian Kashmir almost half of them are foreigners.
General Deepak Kapoor said that with an improvement in the seasonal weather, there might be an increase in infiltration from Pakistan and Pakistan Occupied Kashmir. However, India has increased the guard at the borders.

May God answer the world's prayers and may Barrack Obama be beneficial for the world.
Though there is not much hope, but we shall see how the relationship between America and Pakistan , effected by this change, are in our favor.
That what will Mr. Barrack Obama give to the world in the name of Martin Luther King's dreams.
Obama, part of whose name is Husain, taking the oath today, as the American President, is not only a matter of all sorts of historic importance, but also a historic test.
Not only for himself, but also for all the people who supported him.
This challenge will also be for the white majority as it is not easy for them to accept that a colored man is ruling over them.
Here, South Asia, specially Muslims who have expectations from them, should remember that he has been elected as the president of America. And Obama should remember that President of America is actually the President of the entire world.
After a while, a person whose ancestors were slaves and bought from different regions of the world, is going to become the 44th president of America.
Many people have many expectations from this man.
It is necessary for people who likes him not to have over expectations from him.
if Obama becomes successful in decreasing the religious and racial acrimony, it will be a victory for his fans.
What will be its effect on South Asia and can a meaningful change be expected in the American policy regarding this matter?
How will this change effect the relationship between America and Pakistan.
?
My Sir, whether it be Obama or someone else, the type of policies with regards to the whole world is decided by the multi-billionaire, influential, strong Jewish lobby.
And as far as Pakistan is concerned, after the series of recent Bombay blasts,the offensive reaction of India, America and Israel is in front of everyone.
After the creation of Pakistan, the administration of Swat remained with the Ruler of Swat, who had a regular Army and Law.
He handed over administration of Swat to Pakistan under a pact
But it's sad that our governments have treated Swat like a step mother.
There was no increase in the number of schools after the end of the government of the ruler of Swat.
And neither was the areas development given any notice.
Currently the number of girls acquiring education is far less than in previous years.
The Taliban are continuing their attacks on educational institutions in the NWFP.
Most schools are destroyed in Swat majority of those are of girls.
Not only this Taliban has announced a ban on girls education.
Thousands of boy and girl students are being deprived of education.
What do you think the Taliban have to gain by eradicating female education?
Why the government has failed to stop these illegal actions?
what do you think the government should do.
the question should be that what ISI and Pakistani Agencies will get.
Because Swat people has understand the game that army is there to serve Taliban not to kill them otherwise how five schools can be destroyed in a single night during curfew, how people can be butchered and hanged in the square.
when the writ of the government is not being let implemented, how can the government succeed in stopping these illegal activities?
Now the question is when government has every thing like armed force, latest weapons, latest technology and spy system then why these Taliban can;t be controlled?
the only answer is that there is a hidden hand over their head, that neither their arms end nor they are apprehended.
the conclusion is that Taliban with there deeds making the work easier for World Power
fifteen years before the war was continued in Afghanistan.
ISI is controlling Taliban when at that time opponent was north coalition who was supported by Russia, India and Iran.
Then suddenly the scenario changed and the activities of the Taliban came into light.
And ISI was also offered Dollars from America so past friends became enemies.
Now the scenario is that the war is still raging but the supporters in Pakistan are still the same, Iran, India and Russia.
Until man realizes what is wrong and what is right, he continues to make mistakes.
For instance, when a thief goes to steal something, if he realizes at that time that stealing is wrong, it is a curse and it will bring punishment, and he fears Allah, that person will not steal.
Similarly, as long as Israel does not realize that it is doing wrong, and spilling the blood of the innocent, and it will receive punishment for that, it will continue to play Holi with the blood of the innocent people in Gaza.
Greetings!
The question is that, is war, armed resistance and terrorism the solution to problems?
If not then what is the specific prescription which takes to the solution of the problems?
This extremist path of war does not solve our problems but increases them.
Palestine, Afghanistan and Iraq should adopt the same model for their development, that Nelson Mandela had used in South Africa.
That means political and inner struggle are more important than armed struggle.
kashmiri's participation in election shows that they have accepted this point.
Israeli attacks are going on Gaza from 3 weeks and death toll has reached to 1000.
Despite worldwide diplomatic efforts, to date, a ceasefire was not possible.
an according to one survey , attacks after 27th December has resulted in 90,000 Palestine leaving there homes and moving towards a safer place
Here, aid groups have accused Israel of being careless about Palestinian children, and said that a whole generation of Palestinian children will be victim of grave psychological and emotional difficulties.
What do you say?
What should be done?

Talibans should be given chances.
Basit, Peshawar
Wake up! If Taliban starts the real Jihad, who will slaughter innocent people?
Who will burn down girls schools?
and if kidnap for ransom or not get ransom so who will hang people on the pole by called them American spy?
those Taliban give very damage to Islam that no other nation or religion have done.
Pashtoon Rore
Kohat, Pakistan
if the whole Muslim world just give a joint threat to attack Israel, you will see that how upset will its father America be.
and not only talks about real ceasefire rather ceasefire will be accomplished.
but what can be done, where should our Muslim leaders bring the courage from.
someone tell Ahmed Nayad to take the first step as he is very popular for his bravery at the BBC forums.
The responsibility of establishing peace and human rights does not rest with the Arabs or the Muslims of the world alone but is the obligation of the entire world community to raise their voice against tyranny.
This sad incident the worst crime committed by Bush.
Just like in Pakistan and India before 30th June or the end of the fiscal year, the government institutions are looted, the American regime just before its end have given a green signal to Israel to do what ever it wants.
On one hand, America says that it will try for a ceasefire.
On the other hand United Nations is passing resolution after resolution but practically both had been futile. This only concludes one idea that to oppress Muslims the United Nations is also a party to the Muslim oppression.
All Muslim countries should immediately end their membership in the United Nations, and should establish their own global organisation.
We have many examples of where only promises and resolutions of America and the United Nations are seen, but the harm is only done to the Muslims.
What is the advantage of these actions when BBC does not have to print anything.
Now where are all the ideals of journalism buried? When unjustified spillage of blood especially Muslim blood occurs BBC takes a neutral position of not being a side to any party.
Otherwise portrays itself as flag bearer of righteousness.
Forget about breaking something on its own, the height of heartlessness is that it does not even publish comments
from the Muslims.
The difference between you and Jews is that they call themselves Jews and Martyr the Muslims and people like you live among Muslims, by calling themselves Muslims, to Muslims
[syja786]
For a while, BBC forums have been making a certain point, sometimes while discussing suicide attacks and other times, terrorism in India.
The most used word in these anti-Islamic comments is extremism.
But, who is extremist, that you can easily figure out from the above comment.
When will our Muslims understand that Dajjal can not be fought with the sword?
After seeing the bombardment of Israel in which innocent people unarmed heart cries tears of blood what to do?
But the basic fault is of this turmoil and massacre which by naming Jihad, we try to blacken the beautiful face of Islam.
When majority of the Palestinians have accepted the existece of Israel, then what need does Hamas have to send rockets into Israel or conduct suicide attacks.
The conduct of both sides is misanthropist.
The role of UN and the USA was again seen as favoring towards the injustice of Israel.
May Allah allow the Muslim nation to unite. Amen.
and the real terrorists should be given the noble prize for this painful movement against terrorism, after all they are doing the real work.
otherwise, is this large scale terrorism possible without the support of some big feudal and everyone knows who these controller are.
In this situation in easy language it could be denoted as mafiasm
What a forceful act, hit on the head, and do not allow to cry.
medicines for injured, and coffins for the dead are being supplied by the Arab leaders and asked that
should the Israelis continue attacks?
this is the actual problem that the leaders of Muslim countries including Saudi crownprince are in a false sleep, neither they have an army nor any plan for defense and just by providing aid they think they have fulfilled their responsibilities.
They should take immediate action against Israel.
for example stopping the supplies of petrol to European countries and America but alas they
Greetings to all brothers and sisters!
I think asking Hamas to give up their struggle for the sake of peace is unfair to millions of widows and orphans. It is similar to prove them unsuccessful.
If the Israelites and their supporters are at a rise, then soon Moses shall be born, as this is the law of nature. America and Israel work as gunpowder amongst suicide bombers in Muslims.
Which these power intoxicated elephants are not realizing.
Abu Abdullah, Pakistan
Now Hamas and Israel should seize fire to stop bloodshed.
Mohammad Sarfaraz, Paris, France
rightly said
Supposing that Hamas is 100% on the truth, and they are struggling against oppression, to become successful in the eyes of Allah. Even then, they should know that if a good deed is resulting in the destruction of an established house, it is no more a good deed.
Those who claim to love God, love the messenger and love their religion, loving mankind is a part of their faith.
consequently after muslims confiscation of everybody on earth is Allah's order.
Najibur Rehman Psycho, *Lahore* [P@KI@N]
No, not to kill them, but rather the order is to invite them to Islam.
But Jihad should be waged against those who conspire against the religion.
To fight them until they stop their plans, but this does definitely not mean that you wear a jacket and blow up in a crowd.
Brothers, the fate of the murderer of innocent children is annihilation.
But I would like to tell my friends that yesterday the Israelis did not have any place for shelter, but today they have become so strong that they do not listen to anyone. This is because the Jews are one.
there are no Shea's and Sunnis, there are all just Jews and they have developed everything in every field.
On the contrary, what is the condition of the 55 Islamic states?
they are behind in every field and they have become so helpless that the enemies are killing them and they are waiting for the death.
it is essential that all Muslim countries unite and prepare a strategy against Israel.
Feroz Magsi, Jhang, Pakistan
and there is no better strategy, that recognize Israel, learn modern education and means of progress and let the world live in peace and harmony.
Muslims have plenty of land and resources.
The need is for proper utilisation.
First of all, the most tragic part is that Hammas and Alfatah could not be united.
Great leaders like Yasir Arafat and Sheikh Yasin were killed in an organized manner in order to weaken this brave nation which is doing Jihad for the Aqsa Mosque and this was impossible without removing Yasin and Arafat from the way.
The world is watching that how Palestine was falling down every second after the death of these two leaders.
and how the Jewish lobby gradually kept strengthening its grip.
In 1974 a Pakistani Prime Minister was of such an International trust that first time in history he united all the Muslim leaders under one roof with 100 percent attendance.
Today on his 81st birthday is it hard enough for the nation to promise for unity with each other
but by eliminating the differences between other Muslims will accomplish its (establishment of Islamic Common Wealth) incomplete mission.
This is a Jinn, which has entered Palestine for half a century.
That Jinn has many mouths.
many times this monster criticizes itself from its own but different mouth to divert the pressure and attention of the world.
and this jinn other face eating peoples in Iraq, Afghanistan, Iran and Pakistan.
this monster is most unhappy with Islam because it knows that whenever it will be kicked out that will be through Islam, Muslims, the perfect religion of Muslim and Practical Islam as the history tells that Islam has put giants like Abu Jehl on the right path.
bombing from Israeli fighter planes on Gaza has continued since 27th of December.
more that 3 hundred Palestinians have been killed in these attacks.
after the Arial attacks, Israeli tanks and armed vehicles have reached the Gaza border with complete preparation for a ground attack.
United Nations Security council on its emergency gathering through agreed statement ask for immediate stop of Violent activities from Israel and Palestinian.
However, Israeli officials claim that they will continue their action in Gaza until they are convinced that Israel will be safe from rocket attacks.
In your opinion is this right for Israel to say about this inspection is to protect Israel?
In this situation is the world organization playing its role?
does this aggression has an indirect relation with the coming elections in Israel?
is American newly elected president Barak Obama after take his position would any improvement in middle east?

"When has misfortune departed by praying only"" (Nawabzada Nasrullah Khan)"
BBC searches for such comments and publishes them.
After all the image and prestige of neutralism has to be kept.
although the news from BBC are usually correct but the real thing is the style of the news.
what should be pointed out and what news should be given less importance.
etc. etc.
Zaheer Chughtai
Now In this regard our Pakistani print and electronic media, specially few Urdu newspapers and columnists etc. are not behind in the trade who in the coverage or writing of increasing terrorism exaggerate to hell.
has said that the United Nations which apparently talks of Human rights and peace, but when it comes to grimness and coercion over Muslims the only words coming out of its mouth are that Hamas should stop the attacks. how long this hypocrisy will continue.
Why there is so much atrocity on Muslims. If people like America leave backing up of Jews then Allah Almighty had said that this nation will live a shabby life and this nation can never live a right life. So if Americans you have courage then leave backing up of them and see then their fate of life.
So-called writers and murderers in name of peace should understand that peace in the world can only and only be obtained through giving justice not through genocides.
If any nations can be perished through genocide and results of choice can be obtained then after actions of Hitler, existence of Jews and their uprising was impossible.
In the Words of Poet

Blood is blood. If it bleeds, it dries.
Now who will tell whom what is terrorism?
Isn't all this terrorism too? Why does only ones pain seem painful?
Other people are not humans or blood of Muslims is so cheap or color of these innocent's was not red?
And now why there is no condolence message coming from anywhere?
I saw Bombay blasts operation like this fire was in my own house. Can not see the sorrow of mankind. And can anyone not see this sorrow? Alas if Muslims would think as one.
Bodies on load without anyone to see wounded and blooded innocent faces how does not get words to describe
I feel like crying over the helplessness of the Muslims that on one side people are being killed in India so the rest of the world comes over Pakistan without any proof and asks to perform operations otherwise we will do it ourselves!
And on the other side, Israel is ruthlessly killing Muslims and the whole world is silent. This is unbearable.
God has light not darkness and when this darkness ends then.
Danger to Israel, with America present, is a joke.
Considering elections, the rulers should do such activities for people's support. There is no doubt in this specially when countries like Israel exist. Rest talking about Barrack Obama, then history is the witness that no American leader has gone against the policy and nor will do it. Regime, whether black or white, is a regime.
It appears from the conversation of forum that everyone is grieved over Benazir death but as politician her mistakes are not forgotten.
It is debatable that Benazir died for democracy or for power.
If democracy was dearer, why did she leave the republic for ten years in the control of Musharraf, waiting for American clearance and deal?
Benazir did not come to Pakistan when the people needed her the most, unfortunately she came to Pakistan when she had to deal with cases and was promised a seat of power.
There is no one remaining to say about the criticism and accusations of a historical personality.
Sana Khan
Some things are ignored because nothing can be done about them.
One more Kari
Ladies and gentlemen maybe due to studying the history in not only Pakistan but in its four friend nations and seven other nations, you find the arguments of Mr Psycho more appealing.
Tariq Ayaz
Neither was given nature that can be improved with education
For reflection in water is not always clear.
Britain never let them unite and established the Hindu-Muslim conflict which was later on brought up by Sir Syed.
Psycho
How merciless is our nation. We are blind when writing in favor of ourselves and our party but now when every historical intellectual is being blamed and critiqued, no one is saying a word.
We have progressed enough.
Sana Khan
Some things are ignored thinking that nothing can be done about them. Just like a donkey does not become a scholar if you en wreathe him with books.
Although the ongoing talks between Pakistan and India were interrupted after the Bombay attacks but Pakistan and India should continue these meetings.
If they talk about war then both the sides will suffer human loss.
India says that the man caught in the Mumbai attacks is a Pakistani citizen and he has also written a letter to Pakistan in Urdu but on the other hand when India initially apprehended this extremist, they said he is a great engineer and afterwards he was declared as a 4th grader; point to be noted.
First of all, merry Christmas to Mr. Bhana and all christian friends of the forum.
Friends of the forum: Greetings Mr. Psycho, A. Raza, Sister Sana, Sister Shahida Akram and all.
we do not want the flames of fire but flowers of peace.
War itself is a problem.
What problems can war solve?
Today will give Fire and blood.
will give hunger and exigence.
therefore wise humans
its better to avoid war
In your and our garden
its better that the glim keeps lightened
The relationship of India America have become deep and India knows that when the time comes America will openly deceive Pakistan.
This is that old history of America.
in case of and Indian attack, America would get its goals and the expense would be on India as well.
Pakistan should clearly announce that it will not start, but if injury is caused, there will be no talks of peace or truce, and the war will not stop until India is completely destroyed or captured, even if it involves our destroying ourselves.
This is Islamic history.
. Before this approval, Pakistani public and force delivered the saying which they wanted.
Indian efforts for achieving diplomatic and military benefits as a ransom for the Mumbai attacks are making it more clever that effected and that is why in contrast to the initial strict reaction the world community has relaxed its pressure now.
UN has expressed faith on Pakistani efforts ignoring the unnecessary lamentation of India and Interpol's appreciation of Pakistani efforts is the 'side effect' of unwanted Indian diplomacy.
There is no two opinions about this being a very beastly action.
But the question is that when thousands of Taliban attacked the house of Pir Samiullah, where and what was the Pakistani army doing at that time?
Should the army not be accountable for what they have done over the past one year?
How many Taliban are killed by the thousands of shells fired by mortars and cannons everyday?
I appeal to the I.S.I that for God's sake, stop monitoring the Taliban and let us live in peace in our heavenly hometown Sawat.
And stop this phony operation.
That day is not far when a resolution about Pakistan's military intervention will be passed by United Nations just like the bill which was passed against Jamat-ud-Dawah.
Riyaz Ahmad Farooqi
First our extremists and their supporters are continuously providing proves and reasons for the action against them and God forbid, the day when such a resolution is submitted then it is very much possible that no body will favor us in UN,
And supposing there is a delay in the enactment of this resolution, then considering the example of America, a superpower will come forward to take over on its own resources.
We do not know about the personality and works of Pir Samiullah.
Perhaps he was not a revolutionist.
As the bodies of Comrade Che Guevara, Nawab Akbar Khan Bagti, Dr. Najibullah and thousands of other revolutionists were dishonored at the hands of the enemy.
They command even after they die.
But there is a international game being played here in which place public is ruled by frightening through barbarism and ferociousness.
So that license can be created that if we are not here than these ferocious and barbaric will clutch the government.
Such actions of the so called Islam lovers, in the name of religion is extremely disagreeable.
America sees the torture of these extremists but instead of being sad on these faithless activities, they easily name them as tribal culture.
The tradition of the Mantel Lucrative tribals have said not to take brutal action in the name of Islam
In my opinion, people of our army are with these people.
That is because when they change destination, it takes time. But to catch them, forget about getting there on time, even if they are on the spot, they leave from there.
Are they so brave that they keep 50-70 people hostage and our army just watches it as spectators?
They are also servants of Allah and so is the army.
It is clear that something is sinister.
"instead of promoting God's blessing and merciful nature, discussing various disastrous and lesson gaining occurrences to create an air of fear and terror in the name of religion was being seen. And besides the event of hanging the dead body, their literature and books like ""what will happen after death"" also create fear and terror."
And these people are using this fear and terror as a shield for the purpose of world power.
preachers!
Like you have scared the world from the fire of hell,
You yourself have become the reason of fear.
It is surprising when it is said that this can not be a work of a Muslim
We are either unaware of our history or we choose to not know about it.
Upon the death of the Prophet, upon refusing to pledge alliegance, who burnt the door of the daughter of the Messenger and pulled her husband out with a rope around his neck?
Did they come from abroad?
was the attack of Yazid's forces on Medina not the act of Christians and the Jews?
without accepting reality neither the motives can be diminished nor correction can be made.
BBC people, stop this dual policy.
The better super hit title than this is: the beating of Bush with shoes is right or wrong?
'should have been
Tahir Chowdary, Japan
please show some modesty, a human pulled out of his grave and hanged over a pole just because he raised his voice against the oppression, and you are concerned about the topic of the box office.
For the success of Operation Sherdil and across the border the success of Operation Lion Heart depends on the favor of people.
this act is of American and Pakistani agencies and Peer Sahab is a victim of this conspiracy.
all discussions on this forum will now be anti Taliban since the secret agents have successfully joined Taliban and they are doing what can change the public opinion.
I only want to ask that when this body was hanging for a whole day, what was the army doing? Are they only there for targeting the public. They even report something like this 'Bombing on Taliban residences, a shell falling on a house kills two children and their mother'.
Did they not know about this mistake?
Or were they watching the show?
We fold our hands and request them to please, for God's sake, stop this game.
After all, there is a ruler above you.
Though the question raised from the B.B.C. is substandard, it could only be felt pity at the poor quality of the writers. For instance, nobody asked this. What were the 3000 soldiers camping at Swat doing ?
That the bodies of the Taliban who helps the army is left hanging on poles throughout the day.
What did the Pakistani force with Swati public what did but the media contain BBC did the world unknowing about real matter and it was not good.
The Pakistani army drama.
Every child in Swat is saying that this is a bloody drama.
Stop this drama for Godsake!
These Talibans have destroyed the image of muslims.
Through out the world if Muslims don't tell them Muslims then why would terrorists are found in their territories.
those who become insensitive and people who don't want to work hard take guns and join these groups
Islam has not spread from guns and swords.
Have shame.
There is no allowance of this in any religion or family traditions.
All media including BBC show different views on Taliban and Tribals.
But nobody knows what the actual situation is. It is we who know about it because we are tribals.
In short, its a game in which CIA, RAW, MOSAD and our own ISI are invloved. No one is a talib or a tribal. Who made these institutions? Warmongers who are against Islam, Taliban, Madrassa's, Pushtoon people, tribes and tribal traditions.
due to this action Muslims head down with shyness.
I salute MQM's Altaf Hussain and the leadership of ANP and PPP who speak against this cancer that is Taliban.
This cancer is a product of Zia-ul-Haq who died but also destroyed Pakistan.
But I am hopeful that current leadership will end this cancer.
After Mumbai attacks India said that some extremists are behind the attacks.
Pakistan refuted these claims and said that it would help India in investigation in every possible way.
India said that they have given Pakistan a list of the suspected extremists which India wanted.
Now Pakistan has said that included in the list Jaish-e-Muhammad's Molana Azhar Masood is not in custody and government of Pakistan has no information about him.
before that Pakistani president Asif Ali Zardari disapproved that image that western secret agencies and Indian government give evidence to Pakistan about Mumbai attack.
President Zardari said about Ajmal Qasab that it is not yet proven that he is Pakistani.
meanwhile, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has warned Pakistan that its relation with India can not improve unless its land is being used for terrorism.
And in latest development, Indian Cricket team has cancelled their tour of Pakistan.
Should these political incidents affect sports?
How do you see the future of Pakistan and India relations?
Neither America nor India will break Pakistan.
Pakistan will be broken by Pakistanis themselves.
What do you expect after such regionalism, communalism and vandalism.
although Jinnah also did not do good to the Muslims of India and it has been proven with time.
Yasmin, Chicago
Madam, if Mr. Jinnah's vision was followed, neither the cancer of provincialism, sectarianism, and Mullaism had spread in Pakistan nor the Muslims in India had undergone such behavior.
But it is our fault that we couldnt reproduce a leader of similar stature.
If we can't respect our leaders then
this region has great capabilities.
God knows when they will come to their senses and use the blessing of unity to make some progress.
Both countries have priests, Shiv sena, RSS etc. that constantly oppose peace.
And destructive forces don't want this area to develop and for this these countries are manipulated like puppets.
can you imagine what status will this region of Pakistan, India and China will have in the world.
Pakistan is cursed by God for having robbers and thieves as their appointed leaders.
May God safe guard Pakistan from any harm, Amen.
but Sir, open your eyes to see the surrounding situation and ground reality, you will figure out how far American forces have penetrated.
Besides the country matters do not seems better.The circumstances in NWFP, Baluchistan,and the situation of Karachi in Sindh, are also in front of you .
In this situation country needs a such leader who can unite us as a single Nation.
O Allah bestow your mercy upon us.
Account to my understanding, a final war is inevitable.
Enough is enough.
It's now or never.
This problem will not solve with hypocrisy deceit.
And neither with small big terrorism in each other countries.
Afterall, even Europe was founded after the last world war.
And if this Great war had not happened then they all would be chattering like Pakistan and India.
Almost all of our political parties are agreed on the fact that terrorism and sectarianism should be rooted out of the country.
But our military leadership does not seem to be sincere in these regards. On the one hand, America and Europe are ascertained that we are with them in their war against terrorism, and on the other hand we secretly help the Taiban.
We have to think now and decide our direction and only choose one way. Thank you.
There is no doubt in this that majority of the members of Jamaat-ud-Dawa are the members of Lashker-e-Tayyaba, who joined the party named Jamaat-ud-Dawa Pakistan after Lashker-e-Tayyaba was invalidated.
However, after that, this leagues obstructed aid campaigns, and now on India's insistence, United Nations has declared them as the enemy and even the Government of Pakistan is cracking down on them.
In my opinion if these Jihadi groups leave religious extremism and get focused towards religion and humanitarian assistance then it is much better.
The terrorist organizations present in Pakistan are employing professional criminals in the name of Jihad, the mentors of these and the mullahs are the same people who called Pakistan, Paleedistan and what not from time to time.
Now they are not leaving any stone unturned in destroying Pakistan.
In reality, they do not even deserve to be called Human beings, let alone Muslims.
Without cleaning Pakistan of these mischief mongers, the national security will remain at risk.
Can we still afford to think if we should ban these mutinous or not?
There is no place on earth for extremist Mullahs whose only work is to cause killings.
This news breaks my heart to pieces.
What kind of world is this where it is hard to live for one who takes the name of one major pillar of Islam, religion of Allah.
Non Muslims can kill Muslim, but if Muslim even tries to take revenge then along with the whole non Muslim world our hypocrite leaders also treat the ones sincere with true and sincere religion like they are treating our great leader Hafiz Saeed now a days.
India in impunity of Bombay attacks.
Pakistan relations are affected, and the recent improvement of relations between two countries is enormously shocked.
India has always held the military and non-military groups in Pakistan responsible.
and is linking the establishment of normal relations with the action against these groups.
Whereas Indian security agencies have accused Lashkar-e-Taiba of being directly responsible for the Mumbai attacks.
in this way many times Jamat Ul Dawa Names came up.
This is the first time that relation between both the countries have worsen due to a terrorist activity in India
In December 2001, after the attacks on Indian Parliament, these two neighbors were on the brink of war.
After that, in 2002 Lashker-e-Tayyaba was banned and included in the list of terrorists.
Now Jamat Adawa, to whom security analysts is a fresh disguise of Lashkr e Taiba, is demanded to be banned.
In your opinion, should this group be banned or not?
Should Pakistan take decisive action against active extremist groups on her soil?
does put sanction on Jamat Ul Dawa present India
crisis be over? and how important is it to close down the armed groups to keep constant peace between both countries?
Security Council of the United Nations has banned Jamat-ud-Dawa. After all what proof does the security council have to decide this so quickly?
Does the Security Council always show this type of urgency against the Muslims?
This we say as Accuser is Weak and witness is Strong!
If seen India itself has become one useless realm.
Whose intelligence, army and other security officials has become useless, who for 72 hours have danced the dance of mole with terrorists and India is cheating the world by blaming Pakistan over its uselessness.
If one disbeliever dies then the whole world knows about it- why is this double accuracy?
Countries only religious and non-political, Welfare Organization.
Furqan Farooq, Faisalabad
Our prophet (directives for), scholars and all the saints love the people and gave respect to them, Islam remains a peaceful religion.
Muslims have also advanced in every field.
But when this beautiful Religion rose to the hands of distillation then within the human beings began the difference of religious and disbeliever and the new gateways of pride and prejudice began to open by which the world was unknown before.
Salam- Please do it with pleasure but act at your own.
Do not do it under the pressure from America.
if India is aggrieved, it should provide the evidence.
Why doesn't it give it?
And why do they accuse us with everything?
Extremist groups are also present in India, why don't they put sanctions on them?
Are we the only terrorist in the world?
What is it that India is doing in Kashmir?
What is it that Israel is doing?
The truth is that we are the first Islamic Nuclear State. Why, is what the fight is about.
Pakistan is now in the last stages.
Kamran Hassan, ABU DHABI
Your talk touches the heart and circumstances also seems to be such
Now American magazines are very boldly printing the new map of Pakistan and all these sanctions seems to be the part of this conspiracy.
The Americans are not slowly but quickly strengthening their control over Pakistan.
In this situation, if we'd not become a united nation then history of Bangladesh's creation can be repeated.
Terrorists' attack should be condemned, whether these are committed in Mumbai, Islamabad or in Philistine.
Like this terorrists should be pounished where they will where from Pakistan,India,America or Israel.
Now the question is this that terorriss attacks on Pakistan and many bodies died by their attacks that what is the reason of scielence of the world.
if attack on Marriott was not act of terror?
Then why?
Appreciation for Interior Advisor Rehman Malik, Masha Allah he has become very brave!
n/a
not only this, but according to BBC Mr. Malik has denied this impression with intensity that the arresting of the terrorists have been carried out under 'someones's pressure'.
Praise the lord!
whether having the ability or not or to say that I don't want.
We, the Pakistanis are fighting whose war.
and why we have our own interests which we shall do our best to protect.
No one has the right to interfere in any countries affairs.
Apparently colonial period does not seem to exist.
If people has right view of justice or strengthens on independence respect southern institutions and not help any captain or soldier they there will be definitely peace in Pakistan which is not liked by politicians.
Pakistan is always in line with European and American interests.
This goes on without the approval of many of its citizens.
So this promotes more opposition.
If America and its Allies believe in Democracy, they should give up their colonial behavior and leave this region
Pakistan has the ability to arm and disarm.
Security forces searched a camp of Lashar-i-tayba in Pakistan administered Kashmir.
After Mumbai attacks, Pressure is being increased on Pakistan to take actions against extreme outfits
India blames that Lashar-i-tayba has role in Mumbai Attacks.
Condalisa rice, American foreign minister asked Pakistani leadership to take practical and transparent actions against those responsible for Mumbai attacks.
She says that no doubt the extremists responsible for Mumbai attacks used Pakistani soil.
Meanwhile, the saying of Pashawar commanders is that unknown miltary persons fired the another point of United miltary truks and in result 50 miltary truks destroyed.
These was the second attack on American supply during the last 48 hours.
During this Pakistan raid an alleged camp of banned Lashkr e Taiba and before this struggles has been made to unarm the armed groups from Karachi to Tribal areas including rewards on returning of the weapons and assurance of taking no action.
The situations told that in the past period of President ZiaulHaq the efforts of Pakistan to end of miltary parties in the result of enterance of Soviat Union in Afghanistan and the resistance by America funding did not succeed.
The question is does Pakistan want to do it?
Is Pakistan capable for this?
What do you say?

I have only one question from all humanitarian leaders.
If you kill their children and they bring necklace for you, this is impossible.
Saeed, Multan
And question from you that from islamic studies to western eastern studies, say any logic, argument and philosophy give permission to kill innocent civilians including praying men, laborers and poor workers of different occupations, in revenge of American attack?
If your answer is no then you need to correct your point of view.
People were armed because there was a danger of Russia coming towards Pakistan after Afghanistan.
Now when there is danger that America will overrun Pakistan through passage of Afghanistan of which American president had said out in his election campaign then why should we unarm these people?
Only because America or India army don't have to face any civil resistance after defeating Pakistani army?
Yes if any of them are involved in terrorist activities then only Pakistan should take action against them.
but this is morn, that government against Lashkaray Taiba that prove right India that Pakistan involve in that.
Najeeb Ul Rehman Saico, *Lahore* [P@KI@N]
Even if we accept that Lashkar-e-Taiba is guilty, it is still not correct to blame the Pakistani government.
And another question is that were these terrorists not supported by an Indian governmental or non-governmental agent?
Are terrorists only born or prepared in Pakistan, and not in any other country of the world?
As for as Lashkr e Taiba is concerned ongoing terrorism is not linked to it.
It must be remembered that Hafiz Saeed is the first 'Jehadi leader' who called the Taliban actions 'mischief'.
I am quite sure that Taliban agitation is a vital part of American plans so every person or organization must be eliminated who challenges Taliban in any aspect.
Despite the cooperation of the whole nation action against Lashkr due to the pressure of India indicates the nervousness and flatterness of Zardari and Co.
To terminate the expedition started by the American and Saudi funding, they should be requested to clean up the mess which is poisoning our society.
One should also protest against them that according to what ethics, America and Saudi Arabia distributed dangerous weapons and named Jihadis but in the reality spread the virus of hateful literature and culture. Due to which slaughter houses were open in our country.
After the threat of attack from India, announcement of the Pakistani Army that they will divert their attention to India by removing the army from Afghanistan and the announcement of Taliban that they will take care of the Afghan border, America stumbled badly. And tried its best that India should attack Pakistan.
This showed the strength of America in the region.
Although India did not even threatened nor it has the guts to.
The Taliban attacked and finished most of the remaining American supplies.
That proves that without the Pakistani Army and tha Pakistani government, America is nothing.
Karachi is Pakistan's business and economic center and Dubai of the less privileged areas.
Hundreds of thousands never return from here empty handed, but ever since the law and order situation in the western border regions was lost, all people diverted their attention here.
Now they waant to kidnap this city.
For the first time Pathan's are called Pashtoons. They are made to fight by making them strangers to each other. Although the need is to be united.
One solution to the problem is that the Urdu speaking learn Pushto or the Pushto speaking learn Urdu, or its better that everybody learns English.
You must be thinking its a funny suggestion, but don't you think the cause of the conflict is also funny?
That the cause of extremism be language?
Zaheer Chughtai
Sir, I actually shared this proposal many times in my childhood with my friends, which included people from all religious and linguistic groups, but these people used to laugh at me.
at that time, these rhetoric and religious differences were not that live and powerful but they were boiling inside.
I can never understand what is happening and why?
are these the signs of the judgement day?
For what crime are innocent people being killed?
The reasons are in front of everyone who wants to divide Pakistan in pieces same are active here and who do this they neither have religion and nor country.
Whether it be Karachi or Mumbai, the house was burnt by the houses own lanterns
Whichever government comes, it only changes the names of the places and starts working for fame, just like how nowadays, the airports, roads and buildings are all Benazir.
Does Benazir mean that which is happening to the public of Karachi and Pakistan?
At the height of the Mumbai attacks, the fact that the efforts to cause mischief on linguistic and racial lines in Karachi failed is proof that those politicians working on racial parole have resigned from their jobs.
unjustified killing of Pashto speaking hard workers and Indian threats have awaken sleeping Pakistanis from Karachi to Khyber.
All strict applause of anger from political, religious, sectarian and national bodies is now teaching India the manners of diplomatic speech. They have provided American strategists a chance to think again.
MQM and ANP are responsible for the worse situation in Karachi and administration is not neutral.
Management can control the situation in 1 hour but it is being given wind on purpose.
, police and rangers don't take action because of political parties pressure.
The talk of uniting is only restricted to speeches. The political parties should leave their interests and work for the interest of the common man.
Till the end administration is under political pressure such incidents will increase, Allah bless Pakistan.
I think these people are the biggest terrorists.
and foreign powers are definitely involved in this but no one knows who they are?
but alas that if these incidents were in any city of NWFP, then what would the government have done over there, but since its not in NWFP, the government seems to be helpless.
The government should set up an operation here, and save a big and important town from terrorism.
Otherwise Pakistan will face a huge financial crisis.
BBC Urdu is also not writing the truth under pressure and Pakistani media's condition is already weak.
The whole truth is available on BBC English.
one solution to the problem is that either Urdu speakers should learn Pushto or Pushto speaking learn Urdu or better if every body learns English.
You will obviously consider this suggestion as ridiculous but don't you think the reason for collision is ridiculous?
that language is the reason of violence?
There was another story of cruelness recorded in Karachi, terror of which was being felt by every citizen for a long time.
Wherever one could do something, he did everything. Reports on the media are 50% of what has happened here in four days.
Stayed awake in the last four nights and still afraid.
The people who killed the cobblers and peanut sellers who evacuated the hotel
The people who looted the super highway and cut the ears of innocent people are all unaware of Allah's punishment which can catch them anytime.
In your opinion, what are the reasons of this sudden disturbance?
(BBC)
Placing in front of us the heart struck attacks of Bombay, we certainly do not have to dive to find the reasons for this disturbance in Karachi. But there is one simple and easy reason that this disturbance was the result of spilling of blood subconsciously.
It is obvious that if someone mistreats the father, it is no surprise if the son becomes out of control.
Liaqat Ali Khan and many devotees also belonged to there,for correcting the misunderstanding of Mr. Psycho I am quoting a verse
we will also repeat our elders' traditions
sacrificed for her existence and will sacrifice to save her.
Faizan Tausif Siddiqui
it is very disappointing that whole country is at stake and we are fighting with each other.
Mr. Siddiqui, I request if wikipedia.
see Liaqat Ali Khan, you will will find out that he belonged to a noble Punjabi family from Karnal in Punjab.
Because of his steps for immigrants, today the immigrant call him their own.
Every action has a reaction.
one can afford on oneself but.
I'jaz A'wan
Sir, before you get a large number of people with proposals, I shall tell you that the open signs of this mischief is also found on the walls of Karachi, in the form of posters and wall chalking.
We have been bearing both kinds of misbehaviour.
These thugs did not even forgive Pakistan and the founder of Pakistan, they did not face any reaction.
Contrary to that, they are pecking at the chest of Pakistan.
One Muslim League N was left, even they made a draft of the 18th amendment and gave it to People's Party.
Before this MQM and Muslim League (Q) has already submitted the draft of 18th amendment in assembly and senate.
Till now it seems that drafts of the 18th amendment is a political trick and no one is sincere in getting this amendment approved.
This is why nobody has raised voice in the favor of this amendment in senate or assembly and neither forced the House to approve the amendment.
It seems that by submitted the draft of 18th amendment these parties has beaten around the bushes means they can claim that we had submitted the amendment but the ruling party's speaker did not proceed.
MQM the government, Muslim League N in the opposition and Muslim League Q was the party who passed 17th amendment so how is it possible that these parties will be sincere in finishing the 17th amendment.
This is what is called getting credit for nothing.
Peoples Party anyway is not in a hurry to dismiss the seventeenth amendment.
How would one think of getting his own hands cut.
Seventeenth Ammendment cannot be abolished till Zardari is the President.
This was the opinion of the majority in our survey and it is also true.
If 17th amendment was to be discarded then Zardari would have never become the president.
Now he is more powerful than President Musharraf, since along with President he is also the chairman of Peoples Party.
17th amendment is valid until he is the president.
In order to finish the 17th amendment, the political parties will have to bid Zardari farewell from the president house.
neither MQM wants this nor other parties.
Most of the elders in our family belong to labor class.
in our childhood when we used to see our uncles doing labor work, we used to pray to Allah: that please save us from this hard labor work.
to avoid this we wrote a letter to the editor of the daily Amroz and asked him what should we do after matriculation so that we don't have to do labor work.
The editor wrote in reply to become a doctor or engineer and take such and such subjects.
We were inclined towards engineering and in matriculation we studied Technical drawing instead of Biology.
But at the time of admission in FSC elder brother insisted on doing FSC in Pre Medical and become a doctor.
I studied Biology for hardly a month and then when nothing worked out, I took maths as an alternate subject.
means that the fear from labor work made me an engineer and now I am in a better position than my fellows in the family for which I am always thankful to God.
This we remembered when we were trying to lift carpet from our old house with our two young sons.
"It was not half an hour since we started working, that the younger son said ""Dad, it looks as if I was not made for this job"""
We said if it is true then study hard like us and free yourself from physical labor.
The son said that I am studying and will continue studying, but I cannot do this work.
Whatsoever we did that work in three hours and came back home.
The point of saying is that if a person picks his destiny, whatever is the reason behind it, no one can stop him from achieving that destiny.
But if you do not even know what you have to do, then Allah alone is your protector.
It is said that do not say bad about the dead. But what shall we do, we see only bad things in Benazir even on her first death anniversary.
On one side Benazir crushed independence movement of Sikhs by handing over the list of Sikh freedom fighters to India for her own sake and on the other hand provided India an opportunity to fully concentrate in Kashmir after crushing the movement in Punjab.
The greed of Benazir and Nawaz Sharif for government is a part of history which pushed the country back for many years.
During her exile Benazir continued to give negative statements on Kashmir and Atomic Program.
Benazir violated the London agreement with Nawaz Sharif and made a deal with General Musharaf.
during her rule, Benazir gave a free hand to her husband to make as much money that is why he is known as Mr. Ten percent.
In Benazir's era, her brother was killed, and his killer is still not been punished.
Despite being a woman, Benazir avoided fighting for women rights.
just like Benazir did her politics over her fathers dead body, similarly her widower is doing the same over her dead body.
Benazir came into power twice but she could not punish her the culprits of her father's political murder even she couldn't register a case against them.
it has been 37 years since East Pakistan separated from us but look at the extreme of senselessness of our people and leaders that we never celebrate the mourning day.
It should have happened that we should look upon 16th December as a black day and should take appropraite steps so that this type of accident does not happen again.
on this day we could send greeting to the people of Bangladesh and try to bring them closer to ourselves again.
the rulers would reopen the Hamudur Rehman commission reports and discuss the reasons for the separation of East Pakistan.
They used to make arrangements to bring back the Bahari's stuck in Bangladesh and send them presents to raise their spirits.
But we have become so indifferent that when someone dies in our own neighborhood we don't know about it.
We do not care about our brothers and sisters because we have become selfish.
Even after big tragedies we return to our routine life the next day.
If only East and West Pakistan could become one again, like East and West Germany became one.
We can be one again if we both sacrifice for each other and come out of the hole of selfishness.
But this wish does not seem to be granted in the near future.
Today, when it was announced in the news that the governor of American state Illinois was caught on corruption charges
and to remove him from governorship provincial Congress is preparing for his rapid accountability, our American friend who has a keen interest in Pakistani affairs exaggeratedly said to me 'see this is democracy'.
In America, no gigantic figure is beyond the law.
And there is your country, whose president was made after he had the corruption charges dropped.
My sense of humor rouse and I said what's strange if a governor has been arrested in America, in our Pakistan prime minister was arrested overnight and once was hanged and second time was exiled.
Tell me, has it ever happened in America?
In Pakistan the country law breaker has been departed from President House with guard of honor, tell me has it ever happened in America?
The Chief Justice of Pakistan was removed in such a manner, that despite having public support, he could not be replaced until now. Has this happened in America?
In Pakistan fake degree holder has become the Health Minister, did this happen in America?
after hearing all this the American went down laughing and then conceded defeat.
In this picture, President Zardari is smiling even after being surrounded by Americans from all sides.
It seems from his smile
he thinks that America is with his government. He is forgetting that one year ago, they were with Pervez Musharraf.
This picture has been taken as it was a family gathering
A photo like this was never published in the papers before; one president with three American officials.
It seems as if America's work in Pakistan has increased and now more than one agent was needed to complete it, or that they did not trust the new slave as they trusted the first one.
It is also possible that this was done keeping in mind the notoriety of President Zardari breaking his promises.
If it had been a sensible ruler, at least he would not have been grinning during the photo session and he would have had a subservient and embarrassing look on his face.
If the principle of democracy is applied on this picture then Present Zardari is in minority.
In democracy, majority rules the country and the picture reveals the actual rulers.
Paradise-like Swat is also called the Switzerland of Pakistan.
According to the government tactic so far, along with force, discussions have been going on.
But the use of force is achieving nothing other than strengthening the Taliban and increase in public sympathies for them.
It is required that the government finish the causes of this problem, rather than use force.
By finishing the causes, Fazlullah and the Taliban will be finished themselves.
The proposed Shariah bill of the ANP government will become a moderate solution to the problems in Swat.
But alongside the establishment of the Shariah, the government will also have to take care of economic problems.
from the early steps of General Musharaf, it looked like the nation has got rid of the incompetent politicians, but the lust of power changed all his plans.
Whatever expectations were, after joining the 'war of terror', he began to consider himself irremovable.
And whatever steps were expected were no more.
as soon as Bush's era came close to an end he started worrying about the end of his rule and in that bewilderment, he made a deal with the thieves.
Even then, General Musharraf could have commanded the army, but the present government does not even know what is happening.
"Either its Bajor or Swat, the army does not control terror but bombs the ""Enemy"" public; along with loss of lives and wealth if you make the enemy a mentally sick, then aren't we the Enemy."
Despite the military operation in Swat, a war-torn area of NWFP, things are getting worse.
On one hand the writ of GOVT is limited to a resolution of condemnation passed by National assembly while on other hand the influence of Taliban's FM channel is increasing in swat.
On the third side the common folk consider it safe to listen to those who are in control of the area.
In swat security forces have used lethal weapons and have claimed to kill many extremists. But despite these causalities, Taliban's Power is rising. They are controlling nearly 80% area of Swat.
Result: GOVT is not accepting its failure and Talibans are getting stronger
The poor citizen is the only looser.
"how are the Talibans asked by someone in Swat. It is answered as ""They are very good; they are fighting the war against the enemies of God"""
Then asked how is Army, the answer was that the Army is very good since they protect the country and they fight with the enemies of the country.
"Who are the enemies of religion and country? ""The poor citizens"", it was answered."
I am astonished, how the Pakistan Army will fight with the Indian Army, while it is unable to control a small group of Taliban's.
They could not track the illegally set up FM channel of the Taliban, which I believe was very easy.
But still, the FM channel is spreading poison with all vigor.
After the girls schools, now boys schools are being destroyed.
Curfew is imposed so that tablibans can move around easily.
During curfew tonight, eight trucks entered the outskirts of Mengorah and formed barriers.
The question is that how could they reach there during curfew.
The army could kill Akbar Bugti in his house, but salutes the Taliban.
For God sake someone tells this Army to protect helpless people of Sawat from Taliban and prove that Pakistan army can overcome any enemy.
He says that most of the blood is spilt in the name of religion, tell me that if religion was not then blood wouldnt have spilt?
Punjabi, Pathan, White and Blank, Mehsood and other tribes, are these the products of religion?
Not at all, sir, religion preaches us that there is no white, black, Punjabi or Muhajir, if there is no religion then half of the world would have been destroyed by the war of black and white and remaining half by the war of cast.
Actually, only religion trains man's character and restricts him, as he has not come here on his own will, but rather the Creator of all that exists sent him here, and he must live here according to His commands.
As a Muslim, I am completely convinced that Islam is a complete way of life and the true religion.
After settling down in London, every morning I would first call my relatives and ask them how they were. Most of them had never called me to find out how I was doing, and I then realized that they do not like me calling them either, so I stopped calling them.
Living here in France, for two years, I also felt the same way.
I do not know why people only expect us to call.
Resolution about Iraq passed in a few hours, sending UN peace force to Darfur is not a problem.
Immediately criticizing the Mumbai attacks and restricting suspected groups is a matter of a few hours.
And where death is dancing, we are doing consensus.
O upholders of world peace, life is finishing over here.
If that really awaited for it's ending.
So that no more victim can even imagine to use a weapon of mass destruction like catapult to have his due rights.
when a father is running carrying his beloved sons dead body, even then your hearts don't pinch you with pain?
If no, then you have no right to be called a human being.
Rather you are a black spot on the name of humanity.
At least this was proven that this area was also Israel's country for thousands of years.
Ideally, these two tribes should have lived happily together with love and affection, but since their strings are in the hands of the western and Arab countries, therefore peace is not possible without their will.
and now even Iran wants to fight its proxy war from here.
Even if Israeli action has stopped for a while, it will start again after some incident.
The interest of the owner of BBC is associated with serving America and Israel, and this is why in the name of 'enlightenment' it has come out with a series of Zionist favoring blogs, and is doing a biased and blind propaganda.
BBC is only carrying the 'formality' and its objective is to have sympathies!
I request the moderator that the commentary of applicant should be published to show that BBC still have some respect for facts.
Thanks.
I don't know how this story was imitated but one is sure that dracolla of every age is thirsty of human blood.
There were wars and bloodshed in every era of history.
But the surprising thing is that this 21st century man, who considers himself civilized, is quiet over this ruthless open massacre.
How does he not feel that what is happening around is a distorted/worst face of humanity.
The most tragic aspect: how the current face of civilized man will present the concept of humanity to next generations.

At this time along with Dera Ghazi Khan, in whole country winter rains are goin on.
Presented is a poem according to the season. Enjoy the rain along with this poem.
These rains are also from you
whatever rains is the spring
When it stops there is no movement
sometimes comes without a reason
Sometimes it spread day and night.
sometimes loudly, sometimes silently.
These rains are also from you
in some remembrance some night
to a buried ash
Sometimes we blew out the flames.
Sometimes we burnt ourselves.
Sometimes every drop is like pain.
Even these rains are from you.
All these leaders are about to run holding a very sensitive case, little do they care if the country survives or not.
Let the population sell toothpaste or clean the bells of the Mandir with the peels of lemons.
And then our media is also fraudulent like our leaders.
It's goal is only to extract money from the government, and nothing else.
As for the public, they are ignorant. To speak about them is the biggest ignorance.
Yesterday a strange incident took place.
All the police is running here and there but do not check illegal parking.
Not this, NYPD traffic was not in the mood of noticing illegally parked vehicles.
it happened like this that a plane of US Air really became a plane and landed in Hudson river.
"Till now it is just known this that ""Terrorists"" relation was with birds race Goose."
Yesterday, perhaps it was historical cold in New york.
The temperature does not fall this much.
Even my jaws started hurting from my half an hour walk outside.
Imagine that what would have happened to those people who jumped from plane in the river.
A matter of relief as all the people were safe.
and sad news is that ship of company sank in this financial crisis.
While watching all this I went to New Jersey by West Side Highway. I Noticed that South Bound is blocked, still what I did?
Yes, I was jammed in it on my way back.
Thank God in my one hour trip i was lucky to find one road to 56th street exit.
I had not come across the exit first, nor the long lines.
Pakistani: hI buffet, Eid Mubarak to you.

In this farm you have to cook the meat by yourself including removing the chicken's skin

we considered Taliban group of Swat nonreligious freely. which were only against women education.
They show this angerness daily by demolishing scools and colleges of women.
but this thought also went wrong as some other one according to this news of CNN today on holy day of Monday Taliban demolished boys school through dynamite.
South, taliban has demolished boys school
The schools of girls were pulled down first in the cause of famous English school Ladies First and I do not that the people why did not consider Talibab free of crimes.
It is also known that it is wrong that Taliban are only against the education of girls.
Rather, Masha Allah, they are against education altogether.
These freedom fighters are gifted more power and the Devil
destroying those who rule on us may Allah help them
n/a
By gods grace till now 182 schools have been demolished.
The tradition of engagement before birth in Muslims,to marriage with Quran in order to control inherits and the insistence of many mufties that the girl became adult and sensible in 8 years it was not minor it is not only but in India a girl was married with a frog.
Sea the pictures pictured on the time of marriage.
Sometime before this a girl was married to a dog.
Lets see that groom.
Humanity is rare in 21st century.
It is the age of computer. computer has occupied its space in every walk of life.
many people have many reservation over this increasing involvement of computer, for example, in financial matters.
As you have facilities for using credit cards but by this law enforcement agencies has also firmer grip on your private life.
That just by tracking the record of your credit card you can be exposed.
And in future when use of currency will be minimal its utility will increase.
In crime world risk is not taken to rob banks. Now credit card information is stolen.
Similarly friends are also made through computers.
Social networking sites, like Orkut, Facebook and Myspace are at first level of acceptance.
But don't u feel Psychologically that the more we are accustoming ourselves to social networks we are physically getting away from people.
Like Match making websites which match your choices to other peoples choices to find similarities and you get a list of such matches.
Now can you spend your life with a person like you?
I can not, and that is why the spouse is called the better half,
That he/she may cover my deficiencies.
Perhaps I received a lesser share of wisdom.
I considered true all the talking from any elder.
In the same way, I was convinced that my father knew the answer to every question in the world.
I was even ridiculed a lot on this
But only that seems true which can be possible.
its frustrating,what is the necessity to speak lie
Even at this age, he was harmed by this.
That is why I try to lie as less as possible.
that I do not falsely please others, that too with the name of Allah.
and Allah willing say only when there is pray to Allah that work completes.
Remaining Allah knows better the state of intention.
This is a disgusting problem which is created due to reason of distance from religion.
According to both our religion and Pakistani law, young children should stay with their mothers.
there expenses are on the father and father can meet them.
Then when the kids get mature, they can live with anyone they want.
You are right that the actual problem are the relatives who misguide.
feudalism has overshadowed our deeds.
Even here is thinking is prevailing that there will be more partners in father's property so it is resisted, although this act of the father is commendable should be imitated.
These restrictions have caused social evils, even in our marriages.
Concept of marriage of a divorced or a widow is ending.
These absurd beliefs and baseless traditions are the reason family breakups.
In our society, if the wife of a 50-55 year old man or the husband of such a wife passes away, why are they not looked at in a nice manner?
there is a Pakistani uncle near us whose wife died a good 10 or 12 years ago, now after getting all his children married when he married a widow, his own children have gone against him.
In my opinion, this is religious right, what do you say?
To take place of our mother in the being of our mother what kind of thinking?
I believe that this persons children should have thought what is wrong if he married a widow, after he married off all his children?
Thereby, this widow also got support and the uncle also got someone to look after the house.
Because his children would certainly be busy in their worldly affairs and would not be having time for him.
The reason for this is ignorance.
Tommorow if their wifes denayed to serve him then what will he do?
This is a result of the force of society.
When the people laugh on such family at such action so the sons denay the second merriage.
Although we should compete such situation that their father's doing was according to Islam.
This is a curse in our society in which we are sunk since last 40 to 50 years.
It is acceptable for a wife that her husband does unlawful actions but she does not let him marry another woman.
If she had the power She wont allow him of this even after her death.
She destroys her husband and her own hereafter, and becomes a cause for spreading filthiness in the society.
Chanting Islam, Islam does not mean anything. In reality, we like only our culture and traditions.
For example, keeping girls from getting education and fear of love marriage.
As for your question about the old man going to the widows house instead of bringing the widow to his house, so that the children could make some fuss and then become quiet and relax, (though the stomach of the widows children would hurt).
In the Indian subcontinent, we accepted Islam centuries ago but we could not let go of this illiterate thinking and always thought of culture and tradition as more valuable than Islam.
Second marriage of man as ridiculous, divorce as stigma, divorced woman as untouchable, love marriage as disgrace and man's marriage with an elder woman as the result of her cunningness is all because of such thinking.
And over all, by copying the western world, we are declaring the religious and veil as old fashioned.
Accepting Islam was easy, getting rid of this way of thinking is very hard.
Allah bless us all the courage for it.
Amen.
Writing Urdu was never that difficult.
Centuries passed in writing this little.

Allah Hafiz.
"Ameer Taimoor in his book ""I am Taimoor"" writes that i found this secret in my life that if leader of any Army is in front line then that Army will never lose."
But here the things are altogether different.
To say that Common people are there to die for us if we die then martyr
if someone from common people dies then murder
May Allah bless and have mercy on you.
I was coming back to my shop after the Isha prayer tonight, a man who was sitting in his car waved at me and called.
I thought that probable this man has lost his way or wants to ask something, I stopped as his whole family was sitting in the car.
He asked whether I could understand Arabic well or not. I said no problem, tell me what you want.
he started telling that he has come from Riyadh and here in Medina someone picked my pocket, kindly help me. I said please go away brother, since such an incident has already taken place with me that I gave this man 12 riyals so that he could reach Riyadh, but he started doing the same after moving a little farther.
I got really angry and when I told him and threaten him of a cop, he vanished from there.
this is the situation of Muslims now that even for begging we ride our cars along with our families and make at least 2 to 3 thousand a day.
However there is a clear Hadith (SAAW) that the upper hand is better than the lower hand since the lower hand is the begging one and the upper hand is the giving one.
Allah have mercy on us and make us true Muslims ( Amen)

Wife of famous singer Adnan Sami, reached a police station in Bombay accusing him of torturing her.
The Police station advised her to contact a court.
Saba Galadari the wife of Adnan Sami gave an application against her husband that Adnan Sami continuously tortures her
and treats her inhumanely.
Now this has exceeded her tolerance limit therefore a case should be recorded against Adnan Sami.
, in place of filing case police asked her to consult the court by saying that this case is not under the jurisdiction of police.
In your opinion, is the accusation of Adnan Sami's wife on him is correct?
Can this accusation is an attempt of India to defame Adnan Sami?
Let us know about your opinion on this issue.
Adam Sanghar, Mehr.
as far as blames concern so any man can do on other.
nothing comes before prestige.
however may be the relations between Adnan Sami and his present wife, he left his respectful life and went to India to make money and now this fame has caught him badly.
this is a consequence of his own deeds.
Washington...
top American officials say that president Obama will take strict stance over Afghan president Hamid Karzai.
in the new American policy over Afghanistan, there is more emphasis on war than development.
officials say that Hamid Karzai is considered to be a hurdle in achievement of American goals Since in his government, there is corruption, drugs business has increased and Taliban are regaining their power.
American officials say that people, who are putting more pressure on Hamid Karzai to do more, include vice president Joe Biden and President Obama's representative for Afhanistan and Pakistan Richard Holbrooke.
He said that this policy appeared after President Bush, who used to video conference with Hamid Karzai every two weeks, left. He used to stress upon the American role in rebuilding Afghanistan and its civilian institutions.
Officials say that the Obama government would work with the State leaders rather than the central government.
They said that they will ask Hamid Karzai to intensify the campaign against corruption.
Hamid Karzai is facing fresh elections this year, and it is not yet clear whether Obama and his group will support Karzai for presidency or not.
Is this statement, of the American officials, a forecast of change in American policy regarding Afghanistan?
Is Hamid Karzai's rule coming to an end?
What is your opinion about this?
In the series of three one-day matches between Pakistan and SriLanka, Srilanka defeated Pakistan with 2-1.
Pakistan defeated Srilanka in the first one-day match although Srilanka won in the next two matches.
In the third one day match the performance of the national team was too awesome. The team chasing a target of 309 runs of SriLanka was able score only 75 in 23 overs.The national team should thus have learnt a lesson from this defeat.
The result of the series shows the inconsistency of our cricket team's performance
Despite home ground and all claims, the national team suffered defeat. What do you think are the reasons?
Which aspects of the game should experts focus on?
Are you satisfied with the selection of the team?
which department you will hold responsible for the defeat, fielding, batting or bowling?
Kindly share your opinion.
Malik Babar Hussain, Judah, it is very disappointing that even today these kind of heathenish traditions continue. these feudal lords target innocent people with their feudal rule, who would call them Muslims?
a Sardar should walk himself over these embers. why the present government do not act against them?
When will the judicial justice play its role?
Sri Lankan team has reached Pakistan to play one day series.
besides the Indo-Pak sullenness, a visit by a foreign team to Pakistan is very pleasing.
On reaching the Karachi airport the Sirilankan team was given a warm welcome.
two one days between Pakistan and Srilanka in Karachi whereas the third one day will be played in Lahore.
both teams are claiming assurance regarding bowling, batting and fielding
If the Sirilankans are proud of their spinners than Pakistan has its fast bowlers.
Srilankan Captain Mahela Jayvardena has said that not a single player from Pakistan team but the whole team is dangerous.
Murli dharan and Mendis will be the trump cards whereas the Pakistan Captain says that it will be a tough competition.
Shoaib Malik has said that we have played Murli dharan and we'll see Mendis as well. we have prepared a secret game plan and we shall implement that in the ground.
do really Pak-Sri series will be entertaining and thrill?
who will be dominate the series between Pakistan and Srilanka?
who will win the series?
Who will be the man of the series?
let us know your recommendation.
Gulfam from London has published his own statement, you also give importance to such statements. We wish you also write some truth .and do not change statement like Mukherjee, because it is an order to say truth to the despotic ruler is legitimate. And it is equal to jihad. Mukherjee keeps changing his statements to stay in news.

this all those same people have responsible, Kashmirs fighting for there freedom since last 60 years.
No, no one asked, now they are caught in war of extremism and terrorism so they have started talking about peace and settlement.
first they killed Muslims brutally now they are trying to resolve issues.
anyways Pakistan should understand their double policies.
Asad Khan, London.
India is creating this situation to distract world attention away from Kashmir issue.
but Pakistan has always shown the real face of India to the world.
Now British government has realized that Indian government is maligning Pakistan for terrorism so that it can occupy Kashmir.
And hesitates to talk with Pakistan about this.
British foreign minister David Miliband said that by resolving Kashmir issue will end extremism. Pakistan government will be able to handle the border issues.
it should be clear that the newly elected American president Obama has also expressed similar views over the Kashmir dispute.
The British foreign minister while talking to media in Mumbai and has written in an article that the idea of the war against terror is wrong and killing people just for the threats to one self was the policy of president Bush.
David Milliband has said that Pakistan should not be lenient with the extremist groups.
Due to insistance of major powers to resolve Kashmir issue India is creating unrest in the region to distract world from this issue.
either Mumbai terrorism is a part of this conspiracy?
Does India wants to use terrorism as a means to avoid a dialogue ?
Let us know of your opinion.

I think the big powers do not want to harm Pakistan.
In fact are thinking of means to control Pakistan. They know Pakistan is an atomic power.
They want to create an environment of a revolution.
Foreign counties are thinking that if Pakistan is cornered that will pose more political and geographical problems. They want to help Pakistan and want to achieve their vested interests.
A citizen, USA.
Hindus always hit hard and then start speaking sweet.
I think that they get stomach aches over small issues and begin to warn Pakistan.
We are ready by all means. Indian Army chief should keep his mouth shut.

Political statements are coming under the mischievous support of America. America is crazy and now Indians are going on the same pattern. if India has courage to attack, it should to know the ground reality.
Israel is attacking Hamas, but no one has the courage to stop it. Watching Israel, India also wants to do all that.
PM said that Byden had a great role in shedding Musharraf's uniform and restoring the democracy. That is why he has awarded SI.
No political party can get the credit of uniform shedding and the restoration of democracy. Parliament is not a rubber stamp.
All decisions will be made in the parliament.
The Prime Minister said that Qadeer's door was closed.

American President George W Bush in his last Press conference advises newly elected President that he did many mistakes in his tenure and Barack Obama should do what he think is right
I as the President and according with the constitution of USA and law i did the developments, i put forward American interest on my own popularity.
He said that the enemies of America are still planning to attack America, and that the biggest challenge for Barack Obama would be to stop those attacks.
he said that , unable to find the weapon of mass destruction from Iraq was his major dissapointment and to announce the mission completed in Iraq was his big mistake.
In the last conference at white house, he said that this is my last press conference, and i thank to all those who have attended
Do you think Obama will not repeat the mistakes that Bush made?
Did Bush delay accepting his mistake?
will Obama be able to follow the advice of Bush?

The Indian President Manmohan Singh has again accused Pakistan of hyping the talk of war.
And Pakistan is using terrorism as a state policy.
while addressing a Chief Ministers conference in new Delhi, Manmohan Singh said that the terrorist elements are backed by neighboring countries specially Pakistan.
And that the terrorists who attacked Mumbai used the sea way and remained safe from the coastal guard.
Indian prime minister said that the November attacks were carried out by Lashkare Taiba.
he added that the terrorists are using modern techniques and the latest communication systems. We'll have to be more rigorous over the line of control where in the intrusion takes place. He said that terrorism will not be spared in any case and this is our policy.
How do you see this accusation of the Indian Prime Minister?

On what basis India has warning others?
Give us your views.

This is very hurtful incident that Israel is publicly massacring the Palestinians, same situation is here in Kashmir but Security Council do not even bother by it.
All the groups that are in Kashmir and Palestine, should keep the war going for freedom, and unitedly fight any force that opposes them. One day their martyrdom will bear fruit, God willing.
Israeli air attacks are still continued on Gaza, hundreds of Palestinian men, women and children have been martyred.
Important Hamas leader Nazariyan was killed along with hwife and children.
There meeting of Security Council ended without any decision.
America has opposed the censure resolution against Israel submitted by Lebia and other Arab countries in the session.
The civilian population of Philistine is under attack by the Israeli Air force for last many days.
The whole world reacted on Mumbai attacks but no country including America and England can see bloodshed caused by Israeli attacks.
Why are the major Muslim countries quiet?
What will you wish to say on this double standard of the world.
Saeed, New York.
I think the actual point that the majority of our nation in illetrate. They even dont know where their money is going to. Government is interested in applying taxes and fullfil their duties. Electricity and Gas shortage will remain same.
Because everyone knows the role of those selected by the people.
The electricity and gas crisis across Pakistan has taken a serious position.
On the other hand price of Gas has been increased by 18%. While due to unavailability of petrol, people are facing sever difficulties.
Intense reactions, riots and torturous demonstration are continued in the industrial and business circles of Pakistan against the crisis of electricity and gas.
Industrialist have given an ultimatum before closing the factories.
Here in Karachi, the public is perturbed over the 8-10 hour load shedding.
Industrial activities have almost paralyzed.
Government Institutions are expressing their opinion by blaming each other.
Are the talks of increasing the prices of electricity and gas not a joke against the nation?
Why is attention not being paid to solve the problems.
Can the government see the failing of the country's economy?
What immediate steps can you suggest to gain control over this crisis?
Let us know your opinion.
Imran Khokhar, Madina Munawwarah, I want to say that, as the people, the rulers.
I am surprised that government carrying slogan of public service is itself hurting them.
unavailability of electricity, gas and petrol has become a persecution.
Government has no control over the institutions.
The law and order situation is worsening day by day. May Allah have mercy on the country.
new year has started.
The previous year was a year of protests and political ups and downs. It will also be remembered for terrorism.
stepping down of President Musharf and the end of the eight years rule of president Bush, throwing of shoes on Bush and formation of democratic government in Pakistan, calamities, earthquake in Baluchistan, global financial slump and monopoly.
new year is arriving, how do you foresee the new year?
From your what will be the political and geographical conditions what will be the policy of Obama?
Is there any hope of moving towards eradication of terrorism?
Will the judicial crisis in Pakistan come to an end?
what direction will the Indo-Pak relation take?
Is there a chance of surgical strike or full scale war?
what are you expectation from the new year?

The first anniversary of Benazir Bhutto is being celebrated,she was martyred in an election rally at Liaquat Garden Rawalpindi on 27 December 2007.
Benazir is not among us today. She was a thoughtful politician and a world reknowned figure. She held a special status in national politics.
One year has gone by but the mystery of her martyrdom has not yet been resolved.
Her efforts to bring democracy to Pakistan were not in vain.
Today Pakistan has a democratic government and her husband Asif Ali Zardari is holding the chair of the president.
How do you see the role of Shaheed Benazir Bhutto in Pakistan politics?
Who can be behind her martyrdom?
she was recently awarded with the global award for human rights. what would you like to say about her political and democratic services.
after ruling America for 8 years, president Bush has departed from the White House and shifted to the president camp office in Camp David so that the White House can be renovated according to the new president Barak Obama's likings.
During Bush's eight years rule, the historical attacks and destruction of the World Trade Center, attack on Pentagon and then in the name of war against terror, attacking Afghanistan and Iraq and involving forces from other countries into the war and use of American resources in it have become memorable examples of his time.
due to this war America itself faced the worst ever economical and financial crisis in history.
what do you think the world achieved and lost through this war?
were the policies of Bush successful?
what is your opinion on President bush tenure?
the Indian government has stopped the Indian cricket team from visiting Pakistan.
The Indian Cricket Team had to play three tests, five one day matches and one 20 twenty on Pakistan Tour.
The Vice-President of the Indian Cricket Board Rajeev Shukla who spoke to the news said that the board has asked the Government to allow the Pakistan Tour but because of the serious matters between the two countries this tour is not possible.
Is the Indian Governments initiative not to allow the cricket team to visit Pakistan on grounds of political reasons justified? Can't sports be kept aside from politics?
Is the Indian government's decision not harmful for cricket?
Despite security concerns English team visited India then why can't the Indian team continue its tour of Pakistan.
What is your opinion on this?

I remember an interview of adnan sami in which he said that I am not a Pakistani, my nationality is British.
Adnan Sami should come back to Pakistan at the first opportunity, because he did not get honor there either.

Indians attitude have changed after Mumbai attack.
Jagjit showed his reaction in this form that he hates Pakistan and Pakistani.
One should know that Adnan Sami has sung with Asha Bhonsley. How is he a bad singer now? Adnan Sami Should stay in India, there is not need to come here.

Karachi, On the statement of Jagjit Singh, I would only say that he changes color like a chameleon.
Who gives statements in relation to the circumstances. Pakistanis! open your eyes to how much value you are given in India. Understand their mentality.
After the Mumbai incident, their hateful statements have increased now they are spitting poison against popular singer Adnan Sami.
"According to foreign news agency the situation has become funny when President Bush along with Prime Minister Noor Almalki in press conference at his office in Baghdad when an Iraqi journalist said to President Bush, ""Dog, this is farewell kiss""."
after that the journalist removed his shoe and threw it towards Bush. president Bush expertly ducked before the shoe could hit and saved himself.
The second shoe hit the American flag.
Security personnels dragged the journalist away from there.
On this occasion, President Bush said that he did not know why he did that, the shoe was of size ten, he was not bothered.
Do you think that this action by the journalist depicts the anger of Iraqi people against President Bush.
What do you say about this incident?
After the terrorists attacks on Mumbai the tension between India and Pakistan relations worsen when fighter planes of Indian Air Force violated the air space limit of Pakistan in Lahore and Kashmir sectors.
Due to the reaction of the Pakistani Air Force, the Indian planes were forced to go back.
According to resources both Indian planes were fully armed.
It is the first incident of its nature in the present strained situation.
Pakistan Air Force says that Air Force is fully vigilant to defend the country.
Federal Minister of Information Sherry Rehman has stated that the Indian leaders have acknowledged the violation of Pakistani airspace, however this happened by mistake.
Pakistan military sources have declared this incident felonious.
Do you think India really intends to launch an air raid on Pakistan?
Is India's claim is correct that this violation was a mistake or it was objected to measure the capability of Pakistan Air Force.
Not this incident will increase tension between the two countries?

It is true that she was martyred, but we also remember how many innocent people she killed in Karachi, upon which she was proud that Nasirullah Babar did well.
But later, she changed totally.
But it is also true that she ignored the caniters of its party also and chosen his son for the representative of People Party.How is it democratic.

Are these sanctions under the influence of Indian propaganda?
Why is India blaming these parties for the Bombay attacks without any proof?
Aren't there any terrorist groups in India?
Aren't the world organizations aware of the persecution of minorities in India?
