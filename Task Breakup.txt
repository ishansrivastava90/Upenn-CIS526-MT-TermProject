Score each candidate sentence based on weights. Can implement both PRO and MERT for this.

Default
Use nltk english corpus, score each sentence based on language model score.

Baseline
Implement PRO, set constant seed for constant results. Just output the weights

Extensions
Use MERT - Use Ishan's code
Feature engineering - Aayushi
Worker metadata scoring - More sentences?
Sentence generation - Is it feasible?

Ideas
Deduce if more sentences needed - Given more sentences would this be more feasible?
Worker reccommendation - More of a system level thing. Don't think this can be used
