Ideas
------
Score each candidate sentence based on weights. Can implement both PRO and MERT for this.
Deduce if more sentences needed
Worker reccomendation

Default
-------
Choose the 1st translation as the best one for every sen. - [DONE]

Baseline
---------
Use edit distance on sen as a feature to choose the sen with lowest edit dist i.e the one which has the most resemblance
to others - [DONE]

Extensions
-----------
- Use Edit dist with Lm probabilities (Bigram + Trigram] and Mean translation length penalty - [DONE]
- Use PRO - Shreejit's code 
- Use MERT - Use Ishan's code
- Feature engineering - Aayushi
- Worker metadata scoring - More sentences?
- Sentence generation - Is it feasible?

Doutbs/Issues
-------------
- Edit distance - Do we need to normalize them over sentences?
