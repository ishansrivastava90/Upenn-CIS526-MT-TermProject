The Role of EU for peace in the Middle east.
Officially European Union plays a decisive role in the mediatory efforts taken for stopping the war in Middle East.
according to Brussels' official stance, the efforts of Schwarzenberg delegation or Sarkozy were equally helpful in this regard.
European Commission's Spokemen Amadeu Altafa said every effort is commendable that can help a unified message from the European Union to reach the warring sides.
Officially everything seems fine.
However, in reality, the European Union is in a sad state of internal differences from the inside.
European Union's President Check Repuplic's role is already weak.
plus internal affairs has made her helpless.
On the other hand the course of action of French President Sarkozy depicts that France is still the President of European Union.
Although 6 months Presidency tenure of France is over.
Sarkozy wants to play a leading role which he is capable of, but he isn't the authority.
French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner is facing the funniest side.
He is in the delegation which is led by Schwarzenberg the Foreign Minister of Czech Republic.
the problem is that both foreign ministers are issuing contradictory statements over the Middle East war.
Schwarzenberg says that Israel has the right to defend herself, while according to Kouchner war is not the defense. Germany has also sent a special ambassador to Middle East. As long as European Union does not show unanimous stand, she can not be successful on diplomatic front.
This is the proof of Isreal, which is doesn't provide any response to the European Countries.
this is best time for the European Union to perform, because America has failed in the western side by the law of Goerge W bush
Capitalism Revolution: Death of the German millionare
Adolf Marclay, resident of Swabia in south Germany has left behind a huge industrialist group.
But he was not known to German public a while back.
when he had to negotiate with 30 banks for weeks regarding his debts towards industrial groups, he became the hot news and could see the dark future for Marckay group.
The Merkel Group had to suffer financial losses of many millions of Euro after its investment to buy shares of German auto maker Volkswagen.
Financial institutions then refused to give it the new 700 to one Billion Euro loan it needed on an immediate basis, so Merkle went into deep pressure.
But sometime the drafted messages tend to be fictional too, owing to either exaggeration or to false claims made by the advertiser. Viewed objectively, the advertising message must act as a salesperson and do its best to convinced consumer of the merits of the product.
After the death of his father, when Adolf Merkel took over his family business, he developed it quick, putting it on new lines.
He named his company Ratiopharm which is now Germany's most successful and biggest pharmaceutical company.
More often, they are colorful and catchy words as they persuade the customer to respond favorably and force him to purchase the product. Unless cosmetics and other like Kassbohrer products are heavily promoted, they will languish unsold on the shelves of this stores for a long time.
So, advertising always puts forward the best points of the product. Advertisement can be educative, entertaining, informative handy and surely interesting.
At times, however, they tend to be boring, irritating, incredible and embarrassing.
Another category of advertisements tends to brag so as to tempt the buyers.
After the suicide of Adolf Merkel, banks have sanctioned 400 million Euros in floating loans for his group, but under the condition that VEM will have to sell Ratiopharm so that it could improve its financial conditions in the long term.
After the death of Adolf Marclay the Marclay Group will not remain the same as it was before.

Tea: Effective cure of Chest Cancer
According to a new research, three cups of tea a day,
greatly reduces the risk of the lung cancer in women under the age of 50.
This research from the Moffet Cancer Centre in Florida says that the chances of contracting lung cancer in women under the age of 50
who drink tea three times a day, are reduced by 37%
The research shows that the aged women dont get any effect from drinking three or more cups of tea a day.
Experts believe that the reason behind this is that tea has some elements that are effective against the formation of cancer cells in women mainly under the age of 50.
More than 5000 women who had lung cancer were treated in the Moffet Cancer Center, in Tampa, Florida.
They were aged between 29 to 74.
Researchers compared their medical records and lifestyles to women who were free of lung cancer.
Specialists also came to know that tea had its prominent effect on one of the kinds of cancer, Lobes, and it was reduced by 66%.
Every 10th chest cancer patient has this kind of cancer.
This type of cancer is especially dangerous because it is deeper than most, and is usually only discoverable when it has spread significantly.
Experts say that by taking at least three cups a day regularly, the danger of breast cancer can be reduced in young women.
They say that incorporating tea in the daily life can greatly reduce the risk of any cancer.
Almost 40,000 women are diagnosed with chest cancer in Britain.

Dr. Patricia Paylekka of the Mew Clinic of Minnesota reports that with increase in age, exercise is a major factor in determining proper body functioning.
Dr Patricia teaches Medicine in Mew Clinic.
She has done extensive research on older age and the ability to exercise with increasing age.
Team of doctors used high frequency sound waves to observe the performance of heart.
In which the pumping of the blood by the heart, its contraction and relaxation was studied.
Researches focused their attention on the right side of the heart, which is the main part of pumping blood.
They came to know that with increase in age, problems increase in the relaxation action of heart.
Dr. Patricia says that as age increases, the faults in the relaxation of the heart begin to appear, and this affects the ability to exercise.
Doctor Garven Ken was included in this study.

No chances of instant war with Pakistan: Indian Army Chief
Indian Army chief Gen. Depak Kapoor said that there is a fat chance of war with Pakistan. "However, we are ready to protect our national interests at any cost", he said
General kapoor blames that despite international pressure terrorists' network still exists and active on Pakistani soil.
He was talking with journalists in Sri Nagar.

He said that 700 to 800 militants are present in Indian Kashmir almost half of them are foreigners.

Oh God, Please accept our prayers. Please prove Barack Obama to be good for this world.
Well there is no hope but see what Pakistan-America relationship brings to us in the result of this change
And what Barack Obama, who is the result of Martin Luther Kings dreams, gives to the world.
Obama, part of whose name is Husain, taking the oath today, as the American President, is not only a matter of all sorts of historic importance, but also a historic test.
Not only for himself, but also for all the people who supported him.
This will also be a test for white people majority as it is not easy for them to accept heartily the presidency of black on them.
Here, South Asia, specially Muslims who have expectations from them, should remember that he has been elected as the president of America. And Obama should remember that President of America is actually the President of the entire world.
After a while, a person whose ancestors were slaves and bought from different regions of the world, is going to become the 44th president of America.
Many people have expectations from this one man.
Obama's fans should not expect something unrealistic from him.
if Obama becomes successful in decreasing the religious and racial acrimony, it will be a victory for his fans.
How south Asia will be affected by this change and can it be expected any meaningful change in American policies.
How will these changes affect Pakistani-American relations?
?
Whether its Mr Obama or any other throught out the world
As Pakistan is concerned, The world saw how aggressive behavior was shown by the triangle; America, India and Israel after Mumbai Attacks.
After the creation of Pakistan, the administration of Swat remained with the Ruler of Swat, who had a regular Army and Law.
It had given Pakistan for a period to rule south
But tragically our government behaved with south as step mother.
After the end of the governance of the King there were no more schools founded in Swat.
And also there showed no interest in their developments.
Presently the girls seeking education went down.
In the Frontier Province, there is a continuous targeting of educational institutions by Taliban's.
Most schools are destroyed in Swat majority of those are of girls.
Not only this Taliban has announced a ban on girls education.
Thousands of students are being deprived of education.
What do you think the Taliban have to gain by eradicating female education?
Why the government has failed to stop these illegal actions?
what do you think the government should do.
the question should be that what ISI and Pakistani Agencies will get.
Now, people of Swat can understand the game that Military is there to support Taliban not to kill them because how is this possible that in karfuo 5 schools were exploded and people were slaughter and where hanged at the road
When there is no Authority of Government left than how come government can stop these unlawful acts?
now question arises that with all the advance technology, destructive weapons, and an effective spy system why these Taliban are still not in control ?
the only answer is that there is a hidden hand over their head, that neither their arms end nor they are apprehended.
the conclusion is that Taliban with there deeds making the work easier for World Power
fifteen years before the war was continued in Afghanistan.
ISI had control over Taliban. which was supported by Russia, India and Iran.
Then suddenly situation changed, actions of Taliban began to appear.
And ISI was also offered Dollars from America so past friends became enemies.
the results are this the war is still continued. but in reality Pakistan is helped by Iran, India and Russia
It is a human mistake of doing wrong by not doing what is right.
If a thief robs a place, then he is in danger to rob the same place and same time tomorrow as well. If he fears god and man, he will not steal.
Similarly, Israel should realised that it is a wrong thing to have bloodshed in Gaza.
Greetings!
The question is that is war, aggression, the answer to the Terrorist issue?
If not, then what is the magic recipe that will bring out a solution to the problems?
This extremist path of war does not solve our problems but increases them.
In their movements, Palestine, Afghanistan, Iraq should take the path that Nelson Mandela took in South Africa as a model.
to fight more for social , ethical and subjective rather than armed.
kashmiri's participation in election shows that they have accepted this point.
The third week is continue of Israel attacks on Ghaza and dead persons are about 1000.
Despite worldwide diplomatic efforts, to date, a ceasefire was not possible.
And according to a guess 9000 Falatinis have been left their homes and gone to save places after the attacks starting in December.
on the other hand, NGOs has accused Israel for not taking care of Palestine Kids and said that one whole Generation of Palestine Kids are in serious cycology and emotional trouble.

Wake up! If Taliban starts the real Jihad, who will slaughter innocent people?

Kohat, Pakistan
If all Muslim world attack Israel or just give a threat to do so then see how painful this for America, the God Father of Israel
Then a true seize fire will be observed
But what shoud we do about the cowardice of Muslim rulers.
Someone should tell Ahmedinejad that he should take the lead, as BBC forum's are full of discussion of your braveness.
Struggle for Peace and human rights is not the solo responsibility of Arabs or Muslim world. It is the duty of whole world to raise voice against cruelty.
this unfortunate incident is Bush's worst sin so far.
In India and Pakistan, the financial corruption becomes higher at the end of fiscal year, similarly Bush administration has permitted the Israel to do what she wants
On the one hand, America says that a ceasefire will be attempted.
On the other side, the United Nation is passing one resolution over another but both have done nothing practically, this means that united nation is also working to crush the Muslims.
All Muslim nations should disregard the United Nations, and unite under their own weight.
Many examples are in front of us, where only promises and resolutions of America and United Nations came forward but only the Muslims suffered.
What is the use of this probaganda when BBC is not going to publish it.
Now where are all the journalism principles. When it comes to muslims blood BBC seems to take its eyes off the reality.
which considers itself the standard bearer of truth.
Pubslishing something from their own sounds far, they even din't publish the discussions.
from Muslims
The difference between you and Jews is that they call themselves Jews and Martyr the Muslims and people like you live among Muslims, by calling themselves Muslims, to Muslims
syja786
For a long time on BBC forums, sometimes suicide bombing and other times terrorism in India was used to target a certain sect.
Extremism is the favorite word for those anti-islamic comments.
But, who is extremist, that you can easily figure out from the above comment.
When will our Muslims understand that Dajjal can not be fought with the sword?
Looking at unarmed people in the bombing of Israel, what shall one do other than crying?
But the root cause is this that in the name of killing people which gives a bad impression on Islam
When Palestinian heads had accepted Israels existence then what is the necessary for himas to attack Israel with rockets or committing suicide attacks.
The conduct of both sides is misanthropist.
Then we have a view of America and other countries supporting Israel.
God bless all Muslims to be one, 'Ameen'
And main terrorist should be prosecuted for their painful activities because the main work is done by him.
Or else will terrorist be able to do on such a great level of terrorism and who is behind this everyone knows.
In this situation in easy language it could be denoted as mafiasm
Hitting people hard and leave them to cry.
medicines for injured, and coffins for the dead are being supplied by the Arab leaders and asked that
Israeli attacks, what should happen?
The actual problem is that the leaders of all the Muslim countries, including the Saudi king are in a deep sleep. They neither have an army nor any protective plans. They think they can support and fulfill their responsibility.
They should take immediate action against Israel.
such as stopping the sale of petrol to Europe and America, but unfortunately..
Salam to All brothers and sisters!
In my opinion, telling Hamas to quit in the name of peace now, would be an injustice to thousands of widows and orphans.
If the Israelites and their supporters are at a rise, then soon Moses shall be born, as this is the law of nature. America and Israel work as gunpowder amongst suicide bombers in Muslims.
Power has abandoned their ability to think and understand.
Abu Abdullah, Pakistan
Now hammas and israel should befriended to stop blood shed.
Mohammad Sarfaraz, Paris, France
Absolutely true.
Suppose Hamas is on right path and struggling against cruelty for the sake of God's will; they should know that an act of goodness does not remain good if it causes harms to others.
Love for humanity is the precondition for God and his prophet's love.
consequently after muslims confiscation of everybody on earth is Allah's order.
Najeebur Rahman Syco, Lahore
No, not to kill them, but rather the order is to invite them to Islam.
but Jihad is ordered against those who do conspiracies against the religion.
To fight them until they stop their plans, but this does definitely not mean that you wear a jacket and blow up in a crowd.
Brothers, the consequence of a murderer of children is disaster.
But I would like to tell my friends that yesterday the Israelis did not have any place for shelter, but today they have become so strong that they do not listen to anyone. This is because the Jews are one.
there are no Shea's and Sunnis, there are all just Jews and they have developed everything in every field.
in contrast, what is the condition of 55 Islamic countries?
they are behind in every field and they have become so helpless that the enemies are killing them and they are waiting for the death.
it is essential that all Muslim countries unite and prepare a strategy against Israel.
Feroz Magsi, Jhang, Pakistan
And better than this would be that israel should be investigated and teach them good and let the world in peace.
Muslims have great land and resources.
The need is correct usage.
this first most disappointing factor is that Hamas and Alfateh could not unite.
The only reason to destroy great leaders like Yasir Arafat and Sheikh Yasin was to weaken the only nation fighting for Aqsa Mosque. And it was impossible until Yasir and Yasin were removed from the way.
the world is witnessing that how Palestine had been scattering after the death of these two leaders.
and how Jews second by second strengthening their positions
In 1974 a Pakistani Prime Minister was of such an International trust that first time in history he united all the Muslim leaders under one roof with 100 percent attendance.
Today on his 81st birthday is it hard enough for the nation to promise for unity with each other
but by eliminating the differences between other Muslims will accomplish its (establishment of Islamic Common Wealth) incomplete mission.
This is a Jinn, which has entered Palestine for half a century.
this jinn have many face.
many times this monster criticizes itself from its own but different mouth to divert the pressure and attention of the world.
and this jinn other face eating peoples in Iraq, Afghanistan, Iran and Pakistan.
This Jinn fears Islam the most, as it knows that whenever it is removed, only Islam, Mulsims and the complete religion of Islam being followed practically, in its followers can remove it, as history proves that Islam has brought many Abu Jahls to the path.
Israel With air attack bombarded on Gaza and also attacked missiles since 27th December
in this attack more than three hundred resident died.
Now, after the air strikes, Israeli tanks have reached the Gaza border, completely prepared to launch a land offensive.
UNO Security Council in Emergengency meetings have declared it as not good and guided Israeli and paestinians to stop the inspections
although Israel official said that it will continue its action in Gaza until he believe that rockets attack end on Israel.
In your opinion, is the statement by Israel, that this is an Israeli struggle for safety, acceptable?
In this situation is the world organization playing its role?
Is this situations due to uprising situations in Israel?
Is America after having the new President Bari Obama will there be any good in conditions in west?

In this practice, our Pakistani Wire-net media, in particular some columnists and newspapers are not far behind any more, as they are writing with courage against the growing extremism and terrorism and stressing a lot upon 'Muawiyah hate'.
He said that the United Nations which speaks of human rights and peace, but though the Muslims ar being oppressed greatly, you hear them say that until Hamas does not stop it's attacks, this unfair policy will continue.
Why are the Muslims tortured that much, if the American people stop favouring Jews then as God said that they would live worst lives, so Americans, u stop favouring them and then see their fate
So-called writers and murderers in name of peace should understand that peace in the world can only and only be obtained through giving justice not through genocides.
If killing a particular race off completely is the answer, then Hitler's plan would not have seen any jews survive, and definitely not seen their rise.
Says a poet
Injustice is injustice. If it breeds, it dies.
Blood is blood, clots when drop.
How can anyone define terrorism?
Is this comes in terrorism, why? because own pain is only felt.
Other people are not humans or blood of Muslims is so cheap or color of these innocent's was not red?
And now why there is no condolence message coming from anywhere?
I saw Bombay blasts operation like this fire was in my own house. Can not see the sorrow of mankind. And can anyone not see this sorrow? Alas if Muslims would think as one.
Bodies on load without anyone to see wounded and blooded innocent faces how does not get words to describe
it is pity on the position of Muslims at one side if people are killed in India then the whole without evidence tells Pakistan to investigate or else we would do it
On the other side Israel is killing Muslims. The silence of the world is intolerable.
God has light not darkness and when this darkness ends then.
Danger to Israel, with America present, is a joke.
In Israel, such tactics are used by ruling party to achieve public support.Historically no president was powerful enough to change American policies.Barrack Obama is no exception. Forces of Exploitation are similar in their character; whether they are black or white.
From the discussions going on in the forum, it seems that everyone is hurt over her death, but as a politician, her mistakes have not been ignored.
It is debatable that Benazir died for democracy or for power.
If democracy was dearer, why did she leave the republic for ten years in the control of Musharraf, waiting for American clearance and deal?
Benazir did not come to Pakistan when the people needed her the most, unfortunately she came to Pakistan when she had to deal with cases and was promised a seat of power.
No one is going to say anything about the way that this historical figure is being falsely accused.

although after the Mumbai attacks, there has been a setback in the dialog between Pakistan and India, however Pakistan and India should continue these dialogs.
If the talk is about war, then there will be many loss of human lives.
During the Mumbai city attack, India said that a letter had been sent by Pakistan. Also, when extremists were captured, it was found that the this attack was well engineered by four party
First of all Bahan Saheb and to all Christian friends happy Christmas.
Friends of the forum: Greetings Mr. Psycho, A. Raza, Sister Sana, Sister Shahida Akram and all.
we do not want the flames of fire but flowers of peace.
War is itself a problem.
What problems can war solve?
Today will give Fire and blood.
will give hunger and exigence.
Therefore, O intelligent people,
its better to avoid war
In your and our porch,
it is better that candle keeps lit.
the India-America relations have deepened and India knows that when the time comes, America will openly betray Pakistan.
This is also the history of America.
Because in the case of an Indian attack, America's goals will also be fulfilled and the expenses will be India's.
Pakistan should clearly announce that it will not start, but if injury is caused, there will be no talks of peace or truce, and the war will not stop until India is completely destroyed or captured, even if it involves our destroying ourselves.
this is the Islamic history.
Before this resolution Pakistani people and army has delivered their message.
Indian struggle for having unusual diplomatic and military benefits in compensation of Mumbai attacks are proving her cunning party then affected. Therefore the world has reduced its pressure on Pakistan contrasting to its initial hard reaction.
while ignoring India's unnecessary bobbery, the satisfaction of the United Nations and the appreciation from the Interpol chief over Pakistan's efforts is a "Side Effect" of India's overwhelming diplomacy.
there are no two opinions over this that it is a heinous act.
But the question is, that when thousands of Taliban were attacking Pir Samiullah's town, where was the Pakistani Army, and what were they doing?
The army to should not be accountability that a year, he said there?
How many Taliban are killed by the thousands of shells fired by mortars and cannons everyday?
The ISI, I appeal to the Taliban that only thing and we will give tutelage heaven Benazir Swat to the peace.
And the fake operation.
In National Unity the day is not too far when in Pakistan the military affirmative will be passed as it has been passed against jamiat-ul-dawa
Riyaz Ahmad Farooqi
First our extremists and their supporters are continuously providing proves and reasons for the action against them and God forbid, the day when such a resolution is submitted then it is very much possible that no body will favor us in UN,
And supposing there is a delay in the enactment of this resolution, then considering the example of America, a superpower will come forward to take over on its own resources.
We do not know about the personality and works of Pir Samiullah.
Perhaps he was not a revolutionist.
The way kamaridche gawera , nawab akber khan Bugti, Dr.najeebullah and thousands of protestors bodies were disrespected by the hands of enemies.
Die and he has also been.
But they were playing international game here and, is being boorishness and brutality, people scared of the rule.
There are so that she could be having that if we are not be spokesman ferocious and come to destroy the government .
calling an islamic religion as an endless religion is condemnable action.
The extremists gives support to the cruelty of united stated. But this looks like a brutal action against the tribal tradition.
The tradition of the Mantel Lucrative tribals have said not to take brutal action in the name of Islam
In my opinion our army, people will get the people.
That is because when they change destination, it takes time. But to catch them, forget about getting there on time, even if they are on the spot, they leave from there.
Are they so brave that they keep 50-70 people hostage and our army just watches it as spectators?
They are also the human beings and the army.
It is clear that the pulse, some.
Malaiat, In the period of The dictator of the time Zia-u-Lhaq he did not show good characteristics of sympathies of Allah but there is various tortures at the name of religion and more it his writing "What will be done after death."
And such persons use this fright as a way to get only this world respect.
Wiso!

Tahir Chowdary, Japan
Be ashamed, the body of a person was taken out of the grave and hanged on a pole because he spoke against the cruelty and you are struck up over the topic of Box Office.
For the success of Operation Sherdil and across the border the success of Operation Lion Heart depends on the favor of people.
It is carried out by American and Pakistani agencies and Peer Sahib is a victim of conspiracy.
In this forum all reviews will be against Taliban, Agencies have been successfully indulged in Taliban and are applying the policies which might change public opinion.
I only want to ask that when this body was hanging for a whole day, what was the army doing? Are they only there for targeting the public. They even report something like this 'Bombing on Taliban residences, a shell falling on a house kills two children and their mother'.
Were they not know about that chowk?
Or else having fun.
We say it with excuse that stop this game for Allah sake.
atlast above you also there is a master.
The BBC, was asked the question is not enough to write to see the superficialness regret, for example, a question did not present in the Swat 30 thousand army has been to what?
The helpers of the army were hanging on poles the dead bodies of those who fought Taliban.
The Green sawati step, the Pakistani army has 100, media, including the BBC, the real world and the reality, is not a good ignoramus.
The Pakistani army drama.
The Swat child is that it is a bloody drama.
Stop this drama for Godsake!
These Taliban's have spoilt the name of Muslims
Through out the world if Muslims don't tell them Muslims then why would terrorists are found in their territories.
The one who are shameless and dont do hardwork and labour, take arms in their hands and join thier group.
Islam has not spread from guns and swords.
Have shame.
there is no reason for this in any religion or in any families
BBC along with other media's has gathered information about Taliban
Infact nobody knows the actual situation except us, becuase we are the natives.
( sorry was pretty hard to translate)
This move has ashamed all the Muslims.
I salute MQM's Altaf Hussain and the leadership of ANP and PPP who speak against this cancer that is Taliban.
This cancer is a product of Zia-ul-Haq who died but also destroyed Pakistan.
But i am hopefull that the present Government will abolish this Cancer.
After Mumbai attacks India said that some extremists are behind the attacks.
Pakistan denied these blames and said that she will fully cooperate in the investigation.
India said that she has provided Pakistan a list of 20 extremists, who are wanted to India.
Now Pakistan has said that included in the list Jaish-e-Muhammad's Molana Azhar Masood is not in custody and government of Pakistan has no information about him.
Before this President Asif Ali Zardari has denied the impression that Western Secret Agencies and Indian Government have provided Pakistan the proves of Mumbai attacks.
President Zardari has said that it has not been proved that Ajmal Kasab is a Pakistani.
At that time,Prime Minister Manmohan Singh warned Pakistan that their relationship with India could not improve as long as their land continues to be used for terrorism.
And in recent updates Indian Cricket team has canceled its tour of Pakistan.
Should these political events affect sports.
How do you see the future of Pakistan and India relations?
Neither America, nor India would break Pakistan.
Pakistan will break itself.
What do you expect after such regionalism, communalism and vandalism.
Time has proved that Jinnah did not do good to the Indian Muslims.
Yasmin, Chicago
Madam, if Mr. Jinnah's vision was followed, neither the cancer of provincialism, sectarianism, and Mullaism had spread in Pakistan nor the Muslims in India had undergone such behavior.
It is our mistake of not producing a leader of his caliber
But if we can't appreciate our heroes, then....
this region has great capabilities.
god knows when we'll understand and the region will progress with the blessing of unity.
Both countries have priests, Shiv sena, RSS etc. that constantly oppose peace.
And destructive forces don't want this area to develop and for this these countries are manipulated like puppets.
can you imagine the international influence of Pakistan, China and India, if they are united
Pakistan is under the occupation of corrupt and opportunist leadership.
May God protect our country, Pakistan.
But being a Pakistani we should not neglect the ground realities/threats. American forces have been deployed very near to our afghan borders.
moreover, the internal affairs don't seem to be good, as you can see the circumstances in NWFP, Balochistan and in Karachi in Sindh.
In this situation the country needs that leader who can make us a united nation.
May God mercy upon us.
Account to my understanding, a final war is inevitable.
Enough is enough.
It's now or never.
This problem will not solve with hypocrisy deceit.
And neither with small big terrorism in each other countries.
Afterall, even Europe was founded after the last world war.
And if this Great war had not happened then they all would be chattering like Pakistan and India.
Almost all our political parties agree that terrorism and factionalism should be finished.
But our army rule does not seem sincere in this matter. On one hand, American and Europe are made to believe that we are with you on this war against terrorism and the other hand, we also help Taliban secretly.
We should think and fix our direction and choose only one way. Thanks.
There is no doubt that the majority of the movement league are from the Tayaba Group, who joined the league after the inception of Pakistan.
However, after that, this leagues obstructed aid campaigns, and now on India's insistence, United Nations has declared them as the enemy and even the Government of Pakistan is cracking down on them.
I believe that if Jihadi groups leave religious fundamentalism and take up social efforts, that would be better.
Terrorist groups present in Pakistan, who support professional criminals and the heads of those Mullahs are those who call Pakistan the land of destruction and what not.
Now they are trying their best to destroy Pakistan.
They do not deserve to be called humans let alone muslims.
Without cleaning Pakistan of these mischief mongers, the national security will remain at risk.
Should we still think that the innocent people will be charged with rules and regulation?
In this feurious world the job is war,their work is only to kill.
This news tore my heart.
What world is this where it is hard to survive for the one who names an important part of Allah's religion Islam.
Non muslim can kill muslim but when the muslim try to take revenge then all non muslim with the whole world brother's together think ,that the islamic preaching's are done with Hafiz Sayeed.
After the Mumbai attacks, Indo-
Pakistan relations are affected, and the recent improvement of relations between two countries is enormously shocked.
India alway's blames the pakistan's terror group.
The up coming problems on the taluk ,has been stoped.
For as much, Indian security departments have held Lashkher-e-Tayyaba responsible for the Bombay attacks.
, in this regard Jamat Adawa has also been nominated.
this was not first time that terrorism cause intense relation in between two countries.
In December 2001, after the attack on the parliament, the two neighbors were prepared to go to war.
After that, in 2002 Lashker-e-Tayyaba was banned and included in the list of terrorists.
now on Jamat UL Dawa , about which security analyst said that this is new face of Laskaray Taiba, asking for sanctions.
what is your suggestion should this group sanction or not?
Should Pakistan need to take action against terrorist group on its land?
Can by banning Jamat Adawa present India,
Pak crisis to subside, and how important is it for permanent peace between the two countries that armed groups be dismantled?
The UN Security Council on the party Al-qaeda banned, the end of the Security Council, what are the evidence seems so hurry?
What the Security Council against Muslims endorses such activity is not showned?
To say that the plaintiff slow are witness mercurial!
India, itself has become a failed government!
The army, intelligence and other security institutions have failed, the terrorists who hands may carry 72 hours of the Defense Department was Round and its failure of India accused Pakistan of put and the entire world.
When one disbeliever dies, there is hue and cry in the whole world. Why these double standards?
Countries only religious and non-political, Welfare Organization.
Furqan Farooq, Faisalabad
Our prophet (directives for), scholars and all the saints love the people and gave respect to them, Islam remains a peaceful religion.
Muslims have also advanced in every field.
But when there was a rise of Mullaism in the religion, there was a division of people into Muslims and Kafirs, and new avenues of mischief were opened, which were not known to the world previously.
Do greet them sir. But at your own expense.
do not do it under American pressure.
If this irritates, India should give the proofs
Why does it not give?
Why do they blame everything on us?
Does this banning of groupism apply for people in India who are extremist and other organisations?
Are we the only terrorist in the world?
What about in India?
What is Israel?
The Islamic world is considered to have groupisms and are fighting
Pakistan is now in the last stages.
Kamranhassan, ABU DHABI
You are right, circumstances are supporting your argument.
Now in American publications, the new map of Pakistan is being printed, and all these restrictions are now apparent in the series of events.
Gradually,USA is making its grip stronger on Pakistan.
In this situation, if we'd not become a united nation then history of Bangladesh's creation can be repeated.
Terrorists' attack should be condemned, whether these are committed in Mumbai, Islamabad or in Philistine.
Terrorists should be uprooted without any discrimination of nationality.
The question arises, why Pakistan and other world is silent on the terror attacks in Pakistan, killing hundreds of innocent people?
Was the attack on Mariat hotal not by terorrists?
Then why?
Appreciation for Interior Advisor Rehman Malik, Masha Allah he has become very brave!
?
Not this, according to BBC Mr.Malik has strongly denied the impression that arrest of terrorists are taking place because of 'someone's instructions'
Brother, Subhanallah!
Having this capability or not, this I don't want to say.
We, the Pakistanis are fighting whose war.
And also its our policies we try to save them.
Nobody has an authority to interfere in any other country.
Apparently colonial period does not seem to exist.
If people has right view of justice or strengthens on independence respect southern institutions and not help any captain or soldier they there will be definitely peace in Pakistan which is not liked by politicians.
Pakistan is always following European and American purposes.
This happens, despite the opposition of a majority of the Pakistani population.
And it invokes hostile sentiments.
If you believe in the United States of America, then why not just give up your place and leave honorably?
Pakistan has the ability to arm and disarm.
Security forces searched a camp of Lashar-i-tayba in Pakistan administered Kashmir.
Since the Mumbai attacks, pressure is increasing on Pakistan to act against the extremist organizations.
India blames Lashkr e Taiba for Mumbai attacks.
n/a
he believed the terrorists involved in Mumbai Attacks used the Pakistani soil.
Meanwhile, the saying of Pashawar commanders is that unknown miltary persons fired the another point of United miltary truks and in result 50 miltary truks destroyed.
It is the second attack on NETO and America.
Meanwhile, Pakistan made the show of disactive party Lashkar-e-Taiba and before this was tried to make miltary persons unmiltary and miltary wepons were changed with money and cartainly no any action without it.
The situations told that in the past period of President ZiaulHaq the efforts of Pakistan to end of miltary parties in the result of enterance of Soviat Union in Afghanistan and the resistance by America funding did not succeed.
Question arises, whether Pakistan wants to do so?
Is Pakistan capable for this?
What do you say?

I have only one question from all humanitarian leaders.
You murder their children and they bring garlands for you? That's impossible
n/a
knowledge of east and west is there any logic, reason or philosophy which allows killing of innocent people including Namazi, laborers and poor service men in the revenge of American attacks
And if NO,then you need hard to rectify your point of view.
People were armed because there was a danger of Russia coming towards Pakistan after Afghanistan.
Now when there is the danger of American attack via Afghanistan of which current American President clearly expressed in his presidential campaign then why should we disarm these people?
Only for this that after defeating Pakistani Army America or India may not face any public resistance?
Yes if any of them are involved in terrorist activities then only Pakistan should take action against them.
but this is morn, that government against Lashkaray Taiba that prove right India that Pakistan involve in that.
Najeebur Rahman Syco, Lahore
if accept that Laskaray Taiba involve that still it is wrong to blame Pakistani government.
And another question is that were these terrorists not supported by an Indian governmental or non-governmental agent?
is terrorist only born and made in Pakistan and not made in India and rest of the countries?
As for Lashkar-e-Taiba, the present terrorism is in no way connected to it.
this has remember that Hafiz Saeed was the first person who called Taliban acts as 'Fitnah'.
I am sure that the Taliban effect is a inseparable result of American plans, and hence every person who can stand in the way of Taliban must be removed.
Despite the cooperation of the whole nation action against Lashkr due to the pressure of India indicates the nervousness and flatterness of Zardari and Co.
To terminate the expedition started by the American and Saudi funding, they should be requested to clean up the mess which is poisoning our society.
Also protest them that by what ethics American and Saudis are spreaded dangerous arms and so called Jihadi but in fact the virus of loathsome literature and culture, due to which human butcher houses established in our country.
After facing the risk of attack from India, the Pakistani Army's announcement that it would remove forces from the Afghan border and post them at the Indian border, and the announcement of the Taliban that it would handle the Afghan border, caused America to stumble, and pressurize India not to attack Pakistan.
This showed the strength of America in the region.
Although India did not even threatened nor it has the guts to.
The Taliban attacked and finished most of the remaining American supplies.
That proves that without the Pakistani Army and tha Pakistani government, America is nothing.
Karachi Business Financial Center of Pakistan is Dubai of underdeveloped areas.
Hundreds of thousands do not return empty handed from here. But since the law was enforced on the western borders, Karachi has taken all the attention.
Now they waant to kidnap this city.
For the first time Pathan's are called Pashtoons. They are made to fight by making them strangers to each other. Although the need is to be united.
One solution of the problem is that the Urdu speaking people learn Pushto or the Pushto speaking learn Urdu or if everyone learns English, the better.
You might think that this is a funny proposal, but does the cause of the conflict not seem funny?
That the cause of extremism be language?
Zaheer Chughtai
Sir, during my childhood, I really gave this suggestion on numerous occasions to my friends of all ethnic and religious groups; every time people laughed at it.
at that time, these rhetoric and religious differences were not that live and powerful but they were boiling inside.
Can't understand what and why it is happening?
Are these the indicators of Dooms day.
By what reason innocents are dieing?
Every one knows the causes those who want to destroy Pakistan are involved and those who commit all this have no religion or country.
Either Karachi or Mumbai it is an inside job.
Every upcoming government gets herself involved in changing the names of places, like now a days airport, roads, buildings all Benazir.
What has happened in Karachi, is this what Benazir means?
In accordance with the Mumbai attack it is said that the the task in Karachi have been failed to perform. And now that these job elements should resign.
The Indians in the Karachi should wake up as the laborers are speaking improperley.
The National parties, political parties, religious parties , linguistic and national parties react in a diplomatic manner for India against the bomb attack
MQM and ANP are responsible for the worse situation in Karachi and administration is not neutral.
Administration can control the situation in an hour but it is incited deliberately
, police and rangers don't take action because of political parties pressure.
To unite is only expressed in speeches, political parties should have to quit their interests and work for common people.
until there is pressure on the administration, these kind of incidents will keep taking place.
In my openion,these are the biggest terrorrists.
And there must be some foreign hands behind it but do'nt know which?
And the sad thing is that if such a situation was prevalent in any border town, the government would take care of that place, but as this is far from the border, the government looks helpless.
Government should do an operation here and save country's big and an important city.
Otherwise, Pakistan will face a big economic setback.
BBC Urdu is also under fear. whereas the tax situations in Pakistan is very bad.
BBC Urdu has all the truth.
one of the problem is this Urdu speakers learn pastu or pastu speakers learn Urdu or its better if all learns English.
Definitely, you might think this is a funny proposal, but do you not think the reason for the clashes is funny?
that the cause of extremism be language?
At last another merciless incident in Karachi that was terrifiying every citizen for long.
Wherever one could do something, he did everything. Reports on the media are 50% of what has happened here in four days.
Stayed awake in the last four nights and still afraid.
Who evacuated hotels, killed cobblers peanut sellers.
They who cut the ears of innocent people and rob at the super highway,are all ignorent of Allah's approach,to whom they will be a victim of one day.
What do you think are the reasons for this sudden violence?
(BBC)
Keeping in front of painful mumbai attack of India searching reason for bad peace in Karachi is not necessary but it is straight this only happened because the shed of 'blood'
Obviously if somebody infuriates a father, it would not be surprising if the son reacts violently.
Liaquat ali khan and many Other freedom fighters belong to that. he was writing a poetry to remove Mr. Saiko Miss understanding.
We also will follow our ancestors
They gave their lives to build, we will give our lives to save.
Faizan Touseef Siddiqi
It is very sad, the whole country is at stake while we are fighting with each other.
Mr. Siddiqui, in Wikipedia
for Liyaqath Ali Khan, then he will know that he was from a repectable Punjabi family, in the Karnal region of Punjab district.
Due to his services for Muhajirs, they consider him their leader.
Every action has a reaction.
Till our own is bearable but.
I'jaz A'wan
Sir, before you get a large number of people with proposals, I shall tell you that the open signs of this mischief is also found on the walls of Karachi, in the form of posters and wall chalking.
We have been bearing both types of mischief.
Most of us have no time to think of noises on one type or another.
In return,creating problems for the same country,Pakistan
But there is something to be thought of-does noise affect our lives in some harmful ways.
already there is evidence that it does so in several ways. It has been recognized for a long time.
Till now it appears that 18th amendment was a political move and none of the party is sincere in its approval.
More recently it has also been found that people who are continuously exposed to other loud noises require protection of the ear.
It seems like that after submitting the drafts of 18th amendment, these parties have done their part that is they will be able to say this tomorrow that we submitted the draft, government speaker did not take any action.
MQM an ally of government, Muslim League (N) secret friend and Muslim League (Q) has approved the 17th amendment, then how is it possible that they are sincere in removing 17th amendment.
This is what is called getting credit for nothing.
Peoples Party anyway is not in a hurry to dismiss the seventeenth amendment.
Nobody can think of cutting his own hands.
Seventeenth Ammendment cannot be abolished till Zardari is the President.
This was the opinion of the majority in our survey and it is also true.
If 17th amendment ought to be removed then Zardari wont become president.
Now he is more powerful then President Pervez as along with the President he is the Chairman of Peoples Party.
Till he is president 17th amendment is there.
Political Parties will have to remove President Zardari first, in order to abolish the seventeenth ammendment.
Neither MQM wants it nor the other parties.
In our family, most of the people are of the laborer type.
During your childhood when we our uncles doing their work we prayed Allah to protect us from physical labor.
To avoid this we wrote to the editor of monthly Amroz to ask him what to do after matriculation so that we would not have to do physical labor.
Editor in reply wrote that we should become Doctor or Engineer and study these courses.
My focus was always on engineering, and after metric, instead of Biology, I took Technical Drawing.
But at the time of admissions in FSc the elder brother forced us to study medical in FSc.
We hardly studied biology for a month before we started studying maths.
Means that to avoid physical labour we became engineer and we are in better position than many friends in our family and we thank Allah for it.
This we remembered when we were trying to lift carpet from our old house with our two young sons.
It was only half an hour since he started working that the little boy said " Daddy, I am not born to do this"
We said that if so study good like us and build up your body.
The son said that I am studying and will continue studying, but I cannot do this work.
Whatsoever we did that work in three hours and came back home.
The point of saying is that if a person picks his destiny, whatever is the reason behind it, no one can stop him from achieving that destiny.
Here if you do not know what you have to do then God help you!
It is said that don't accuse the dead, but can't help it as we see only evils in her on the first anniversary of Benazir.
For personal interests, Benazir handed over the list of Sikhs who were fighting for independence to India, at the same time crushing the Sikhs independence movement and also allowing India to transfer its complete attention to Pakistan, having taken care of the Punjab movement.
Tug of war between Benazir and Nawaz Sharif rule is part of the history, which has pushed the country back many years.
Benazir continued to speak ill about Kashmir and the atomic program throughout exile.
Benazir violated the London agreement with Nawaz Sharif and made a deal with General Musharaf.
Benazir allowed her husband to openly earn money, in her era, which is why he came to be known as Mr. Ten Percent.
In Benazir's era, her brother was killed, and his killer is still not been punished.
Despite being a woman, Benazir avoided fighting for women rights.
Just like Benazir politicized her father's dead body similarly his widower husband politicizing her dead body.
Benazir reigned twice but not only she failed to punish her father's political murder but could not file a case against them.
It has been 37 years since the separation of eastern Pakistan, and sadly no leader condemns this day nor do they call it a black day.
We should have been observing 16th December as a day of reflection, and made plans to prevent the re occurrence of such incidents.
on this day we could send greeting to the people of Bangladesh and try to bring them closer to ourselves again.
Now we look at the reasons why eastern Pakistan was separated.
They used to make arrangements to bring back the Bahari's stuck in Bangladesh and send them presents to raise their spirits.
we have no feeling, our neighbors get died and we dont even know about it
we don't care about brothers and sisters because we are selfish.
big crisis get over and we became normal and return to our routines.
If only East and West Pakistan could become one again, like East and West Germany became one.
we can be one again, if we scarifies for each other and get over with our selfishness.
But this wish does not seem to be fulfilled in the near future
Today in new it was said that Governor of illinois is arrested for corruption.
and to remove him from governorship provincial Congress is preparing for his rapid accountability, our American friend who has a keen interest in Pakistani affairs exaggeratedly said to me 'see this is democracy'.
No one is beyond the law in America.
And there is your country, whose president was made after he had the corruption charges dropped.
we felt our nerve of wit and said that what if a governor was arrested in America,in our Pakistan once our prime minister was arrested during the night and was hanged and the other time was exiled.
tell me when it happened in America?
Pakistan sent off the lawbreaker with guard of honor from the presidency, tell me when did such thing happened it America?
In Pakistan Chief Justice has been dismissed as despite of public support he is not reinstated yet, has this ever happened in America?
In Pakistan, a fake-degree holder was made the Minister of Health. Did this happen in America?
Hearing this, the American laughed till he was tired and conceded defeat.
In the picture, despite being flanked by Americans from all sides, President Zardari is smiling.
it looks from his smile
he thinks that America is with his government. He is forgetting that one year ago, they were with Pervez Musharraf.
Thus psychotherapy gained popularity.
A photo like this was never published in the papers before; one president with three American officials.
That said, mental health care has come a long way from merely addressing dementia to dealing with problems such as stress, depression, anxiety and relationship problems.
When she finished her MA in counseling psychology from Columbia university.
The center offers support services for depression, anxiety,stress, learning problems,personality. deficiencies
Material problems and workplace issues.
It also offers employee assistance programs for corporates.
Paradise-like Swat is also called the Switzerland of Pakistan.
The government’s policy so far is to engage in talks besides the use of force.
Research has revealed that there are conditions which can be cured without medication.
Instead of using power, government should find out the real causes of the problem.
by eliminating the causes Fazlullah and Taliban will automatically finish.
The Shariat Bill by the ANP government will help to address the problem to a great extent.
But alongside the establishment of the Shariah, the government will also have to take care of economic problems.
From General Musharraf's initial few steps, it looked as if the nation would be freed of useless politicians, but the love for power changed all his plans.
He also to the amadein
Hopes of taking actions were lost.
When the rule of Bush was at an end he was scared and he started dealing with theives
General Musharraf, the army had to control, but the present Government not only to what is the.
If it was Bajaur, or Swat the terror was uncontrollable by army.

I am astonished, how the Pakistan Army will fight with the Indian Army, while it is unable to control a small group of Taliban's.
They are unable to track the non-juduicial F.M channel which is running by taliban,according to me that is very easy.
But still FM was spreading hatred in full swing.
After the girls school, now they are demolishing the schools for boys.
curfew is imposed to facilitate the taliban's movement
During curfew tonight, eight trucks entered the outskirts of Mengorah and formed barriers.
Question arises, how did they reach there during curfew?
Army could kill Akbar Bugti in his house and salutes Taliban.
For God's sake, Army should take actions to free the helpless people of Swat from the brutal occupation of Taliban. This will improve the image of Pakistan Army.
He says that most of the blood is spilt in the name of religion, tell me that if religion was not then blood wouldnt have spilt?
Are Punjabi, Pathan, White, Black, Mahsood and other tribes the result of religion?
No not at all.A religion teaches that there is no white no black, there is no Punjabi no immigrant.If there was no religion then people would have destroyed each other and other things in the battle of black and white.
Actually religion nourishes human morally and restricts him that he is not here at his own rather is sent by The Creator of Universe and he has to live by God's rules.
As a Muslim I believe that Islam is true religion and a complete code of life.
After moving to London, I used to call my relatives back home every single morning, although they never called us even once. Then I realized they were inconvenienced by our calling as well, so we stopped.
Living here in France, for two years, I also felt the same way.
Do not know why people expect us to call.
Resolution about Iraq passed in a few hours, sending UN peace force to Darfur is not a problem.
Immediate condemning Mumbai battacks and restricting suspected groups can be done in few hours.
And where death is dancing, we are doing consensus.
O' world peace claimers!Life is ending here.
is it really being waited to diminish.
So that no more victim can even imagine to use a weapon of mass destruction like catapult to have his due rights.
Doesn't your hear ache even when a father is running holding his son's dead body?
If not, you have no right to be called a human.
Instead a blot on the humanity.
It has been proved that this area is from thousands of years is also Israelis country
ideally these two nations should have lived in harmony but since their strings are in Western and Arab hands, so without their will peace can not prevail in this region.
Moreover Iran also wants to fight its proxy war from here.
If Israel stops for meantime, then again for some reasons after a while it will start.
The interest of the owner of BBC is associated with serving America and Israel, and this is why in the name of 'enlightenment' it has come out with a series of Zionist favoring blogs, and is doing a biased and blind propaganda.
BBC is only carrying the 'formality' and its objective is to have sympathies!
I request the moderator that the commentary of applicant should be published to show that BBC still have some respect for facts.
Thankyou.
I don't know how this story was imitated but one is sure that dracolla of every age is thirsty of human blood.
Every era has seen war as well as blood shed.
It is strange that man of 21st century, which claim more civilized, does not show any concern over open bloodshed.
How does he not feel that what is happening around is a distorted/worst face of humanity.

At the moment in Dera Ghazi khan and in other parts of the country, it is raining.
Presented is a poem according to the season. Enjoy the rain along with this poem.
Do you have this heavy rains too?
It has been Bihar in this year.
As the stay has really been.
Sometimes comes, with no reason
Sometimes it spread day and night.
sometimes loudly, sometimes silently.
It rains.. but just because of you
Remember any night
A suppressed music!
Sometimes he put it out
Sometimes it burnt itself.
The grief was in a gradual.
Do you have this heavy rains too?
All these things in the right to take the country, those people, or in a.

Yesterday a strange incident took place.
All police are running here and there, but don't ask about illegal parking.
Not this, NYPD traffic was not in the mood of noticing illegally parked vehicles.
What happened was, an airplane of US Air crash landed in the Hudson River.
Until now, we only now that terrorists are of the descendants of geese.
Yesterday was perhaps historic cold, in New York.
The temperature does not fall this much.
Pain started in my own jaw, after walking outside for half an hour .
Imagine, how the people who jumped from the plane into the river would have felt.
A matter of relief as all the people were safe.
The dark side is that the Company's plane crashed in this financial crises.
Seeing all those sites, I reached New Jersey Side from West Side Highway. There I found South Bond closed. What should I do?
Yes, I was jammed in it on my way back.
Thank God in my one hour trip i was lucky to find one road to 56th street exit.
And i didn't see the lines in that exit.

we considered Taliban group of Swat nonreligious freely. which were only against women education.
They show this angerness daily by demolishing scools and colleges of women.
But usually this belief is not been streghtened, According to CNN today monday Taliban has demolished a school for boys.

look at that groom.
Humanity is rare in 21st century.
This is the time of the computers and their role in our lives is ever increasing.
many people have many reservation over this increasing involvement of computer, for example, in financial matters.
Although credit card users have facility but their personal life is under more control of law enforcement agencies.
That just by tracking the record of your credit card you can be exposed.
In future when usage of currency will become lesser, its importance will increase.
In crime world risk is not taken to rob banks. Now credit card information is stolen.
Similarly friendship has become computerized
Social networking sites, like Orkut, Facebook and Myspace are at first level of acceptance.
But don't you feel that the more closer we are getting of these sites mentally, practically moving further away from people.
So, this way you have been seen your wanted people and their index in the match making website.
Now can you spend your life with a person like you?
I can not, and that is why the spouse is called the better half,
That he/she may cover my deficiencies.
Perhaps I have got a small share of sense.
I used to believe everything someone elder says.
In the same way, I thought that my father knew the answer to every question on earth.
There was laughed upon me for it.
But only that seemed true which was plausible.
its frustrating,what is the necessity to speak lie
Even at this age, he was harmed by this.
So I tried to keep the lies at a minimum.
don't say lie specially in the name of God
and Allah willing say only when there is pray to Allah that work completes.
Remaining Allah knows better the state of intention.
this is the Only complicated problem due to the distance from the religion.
According to Our Religion and the Law of Pakistan Minor should stay with their Mother.
there expenses are on the father and father can meet them.
Then when the kids get mature, they can live with anyone they want.
You have rightly said about the misunderstandings relatives create.
Possessiveness is present in all our actions.
Thinking the same thing here working in the property of the father, a new parts and will be opposed the same otherwise his father, the process is commendable and counterfeiting.
These restrictions have caused social evils, even in our marriages.
Related widow and the concept of marriage is scarce.
These absurd beliefs and baseless traditions are the reason family breakups.
In our society, if wife of a 50-55 year old man or husband of a woman goes to the next world and he marries again, why is he not respected?
Near us, there is a Pakistani uncle, whose wife passed away 10-12 years ago. Now, after marrying off all his children, he has married a widow, so even his children have gone against him.
In my opinion, this is religious right, what do you say?
"To take place of our mother in the being of our mother" what kind of thinking?
According to my thinking his sons should thik that what did he done wrong when he married with widdow after the merriage of children?
By this that widdow got a helper and he got a person to manage his home.
Because his sons and daughters engaged in their life and will not care him.
Reason for this is unknowledgeable
In future what if their wives refused to work for the old man?
This is a result of the force of society.
When the people laugh on such family at such action so the sons denay the second merriage.
Although we should compete such situation that their father's doing was according to Islam.
This is the curse of our society, which we are facing for the last 40-50 years.
Even a wife is agreed on the unethical activities of her husband but does not allow her for second marriage.
If possible, stop him from doing so, even after you die.
She destroys her husband and her own hereafter, and becomes a cause for spreading filthiness in the society.
Chanting Islam, Islam does not mean anything. In reality, we like only our culture and traditions.
like, demotivation for the girls education, and love marriage, etc.,
The question is that, the widow of the house have a abdominal contraction again.
In IndopPak we embraced Islam centuries ago but can't get rid of this unlettered thinking and considered traditions and customs superior then Islam.
Second marriage of man as ridiculous, divorce as stigma, divorced woman as untouchable, love marriage as disgrace and man's marriage with an elder woman as the result of her cunningness is all because of such thinking.
Moreover to copy the western nations we declare veil and worship backward.
Accepting Islam is easy, but leaving this mentality is very tough.
Allah give us courage and Daringness.
Amen.
Writing Urdu was never that difficult.

I was coming back to my shop after the Isha prayer tonight, a man who was sitting in his car waved at me and called.
I thought this person has lost his way or wanted to ask something to me i stopped i saw his whole family along him.
He asked whether I could understand Arabic well or not. I said no problem, tell me what you want.
He started to say that I have come from Riyadh, to Madinah, but someone has pick-pocketed me, so please help me out. I asked him to excuse me, as such an incident had taken place with me previously, that I had given the person 20 Riyals to buy petrol to reach Riyadh, but he went a little ahead and started to ask somebody else.
I was furious, I cursed him and threatened him of the Police, then he ran away.
Now the situation has become, that we Muslims come on cars, with our families to beg throughout the day and gain at least two or three thousand illegally.
Where as in Hadis(saleallah huwa salam) preaches instead of down peoples upper peoples are greater god gives them.
May Allah bless us and make us true Muslims (Amen)

The police station suggester her to contact Court.
Adnan Sami's wife Saba Guladari submitted a plea against her husband that Adnan Sami tortures her continuously.

Now she is fed up of this therefore case must be filed against him
, in place of filing case police asked her to consult the court by saying that this case is not under the jurisdiction of police.
Do you think that the accusation on Adnan Sami by his wife is correct?
Is it not an attempt of India to defame Adnan Sami?
Inform us about your opinion on the Subject.
Adam Saanghar, stamp.
as far as blames concern so any man can do on other.
nothing more important than respect.
Whatever be the case between Adnan Sami and his present wife, he had left his honorable life and went to India to earn money. Now that fame has fallen around his neck.
this is due to his own deed.
Washington.
High ambassadors of America say that President Obama will take a strong stand against Afghan President Hamid Karzai.
in the new American policy over Afghanistan, there is more emphasis on war than development.
Official said that Hamid Karzai consider as a hurdle in Afghanistan to get American Aid, because corruption in the government, intoxication business get increased and Taliban forces get regathered.
The American officials also said that those people in the current administration who are pressurizing Hamid Karzai to do more include, Vice President Joe Biden and American Envoy for Afghanistan and Pakistan, Richard Holbrook
He said that the strategy came forward after President Bush left. He participated in video conference with Hamid Karzay every fortnight. Those conferences emphasized America's role in reconstructing Afghanistan and its cities.
The Obama administration will work with provincial political leaders instead of the central government.
The officials say that it will pressurize Karzai to step up the war against corruption.
Hamid Karzay is going to face a new election and it is not still clear whether Obama and his friends will support Karzay's candidature for Presidentship.
Does this statement reflect a shift in American policy towards Afghanistan?
Is this era of Hamid Karzai ending?
What do you think about it?

Sri Lankan team has reached Pakistan to play one day series.
besides the Indo-Pak sullenness, a visit by a foreign team to Pakistan is very pleasing.
On reaching Karachi Airport the Sir Lankan team was given a warm welcome.
There will be two one day matches in Karachi and one in Lahore between Pakistan and Sirilanka.
Both teams are asserting highly regarding their batting, bowling and fielding.
If Siri Lanka venerates its spinners, Pakistan’s reliance is on its fast bowlers.
Srilankan Captain Mahela Jaywardena has said that No one Player of Pakistan team but Whole Pakistan team is dangerous

All this is done by these people. Kashmir is fighting for its freedom from past 60 years.
No, no one asked, and they are now stuck in their war of extremism and terrorism, so they start talking about making up.
first killed Muslims openly now heading for cover it
In any way Pakistan has to understand their duplicitous policies.
Asad Khan, London.
India is making situations so that the Kashmir situation is overlooked.
but Pakistan always shows India real face to the world.
Now British government has realized that Indian government is maligning Pakistan for terrorism so that it can occupy Kashmir.
And hesitates to talk with Pakistan about this.
British foreign minister David Miliband said that by resolving Kashmir issue will end extremism. Pakistan government will be able to handle the border issues.
It should be noted that American president Obama has already expressed similar views on Kashmir issue.
Britains Secretary of State said in front of media in Mumbai and also wrote that the idea of war against terrorism is wrong.Killing people for the sake of threats being faced had been the policy of President Bush
David Milliband has said that Pakistan should not be lenient with the extremist groups.
Is India creating uncertainity in the region to avoid the resolution of Kashmir issue by big powers?
either Mumbai terrorism is a part of this conspiracy?
Is India using terrorism as a base to escape from comprehensive dialog?

I think Super powers don't want to destroy Pakistan
In fact are thinking of means to control Pakistan. They know Pakistan is an atomic power.
want to bring some sort of revolution
Foreign countries believe that by cornering Pakistan few hurdles may generate want to support Pakistan and also wish to achieve their goal

This is a sad calamity that Israeli is massacring the Palestinians and the same situation is prevalent in Kashmir, but there is no effect on the Security Council.
The Associations in Kashmir and Palestian, ther have to fight for their freedom, and they to be united and strrugle to all dangerous situations. definitely one day their struggle will give you a good result. Insha Allah
Israeli air attacks are still continued on Gaza, hundreds of Palestinian men, women and children have been martyred.
Important Hamas leader Nazariyan was killed along with hwife and children.
The Security Council session ended without any decision.
The conference was conducted against Isreal by Libya and other gulf countries, and the report was submitted to America
From the last few days there has been bombing by Israeli planes on the Palestinian civilian population.
Every country around the world began to protest against the Mumbai attacks but can't anyone see this brutality including America and Britain?
Why the leading Muslim countries are silent?
What would you say on world's double standard?
Saeed, New York.
I think the problem lies in the illiteracy of our nation. People do not know how their money is spent. Govt. is solving its problems by introducing new taxes. Power and Gas crisis will remain unsolved
Because everyone knows the role of those selected by the people.
Power crisis has become worst in Pakistan.
On the other hand price of Gas has been increased by 18%. While due to unavailability of petrol, people are facing sever difficulties.
The business and industrial communities of Pakistan are violently protesting against power and Gas crisis.
Industrialists have threatened a shutdown ultimatum.
In Karachi people are worried due to 8 to 10 hours load shedding.
Industrial sector is almost paralyzed.
Government Institutions are expressing their opinion by blaming each other.
Increasing the prices of electricity and gas is not a joke with people?
Why the solutions of the problems are not considered?
The government is not going to work for upwards.
What will you suggest about the control this big problem.
Aware me about your openion.
Imran Khokhar, Madina Munawwarah, I want to say that, as the people, the rulers.
I am surprised that they are giving difficulty to the public who called for a democratic government.
unavailability of electricity, gas and petrol has become a persecution.
Government departments have lost control.
Law and order has been degenerated. May Allah show his mercy on this country of ours.

Salman, Karachi
People who are proud to go to India
and direct or produce their videos in India should open their eyes that what response India is giving.
I remember an interview of Adnan Sami in which he said that he is not Pakistani national but a British.
Adnan Sami should come back to Pakistan at the first opportunity, because he did not get honor there either.
Farid Ahmad

Indian's attitude has changed after Bombay Attacks.
Jugjeet singh started hating Pakistan and Pakistanis as its reaction.
it should be known that Adnan Sami sung seven songs of Asha Bhosla, now how can he be out of tune, Adnan Sami should stay in India, no need to come here.
Muhammad Shamshad Aalam,
Regarding Jagjit Singh I would tell that he changes colors like a chameleon .
Who gives statements in relation to the circumstances. Pakistanis! open your eyes to how much value you are given in India. Understand their mentality.
After the Mumbai attack their feeling of hate has increased.Now they are talking against the famous singer Adnan Sami.
Without my permission at all, a dream takes place in my mind. I must have a house in a beautiful evergreen valley. There must be flowering trees on top of the hill.

Second shoe hit the American flag.
Security officials dragged him out of there.
On this occasion, President Bush said that he did not know why he did that, the shoe was of size ten, he was not bothered.
Do you think that this action by the journalist depicts the anger of Iraqi people against President Bush.
What will you say about this?
By wearing a mask repeatedly, you have lost your face. You have developed the art of having the brightness of truth even while uttering point blank lies.
I was always dominated by an uncontrollable thirst for affection.
When my problem is something concerned with money.
It is the first incident of its nature in the present strained situation.
Pakistan Air Force says that Air Force is all set for country's air defense.
The consequence of the fact that it is very dangerous to face the problems that arise in the world future.
Pakistan Army resources declared this incident as crucial.
What did the people seriously think about that?
Poverty, financial crisis, diseases are the main challenges that people going to face in the world in future.
Not this incident will increase tension between the two countries?

But later,changed at all.
